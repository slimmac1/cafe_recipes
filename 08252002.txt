Dear Recipe Fan Chris,

With the summer heat still around for most of us, 
we are searching for light and easy meals.  Sometimes 
it's refreshing to have just a salad.  A bowl full of 
the greens of your choice, with a couple boiled eggs, 
some onion, cucumber, tomato, peppers, or other 
vegetable choices.

Another quick idea is to cook the pasta of your choice, 
maybe add some steamed veggies such as broccoli, 
cauliflower, carrots, or some pea pods.  Combine this 
with a quick Alfredo sauce, a Carbonara sauce, or Creamy 
Garlic sauce.

Baked potatoes are a great entree to lavish with cheese 
sauce.  Keep the pitcher handy to smother your broccoli 
or asparagus as well. The sauce is also what makes 
coleslaw yummy.

Sometimes the heat of summer can rule out even grandma's 
homemade sauces.  Get daring this week and stock up on a 
wide selection of packaged sauces that are quick, easy 
and extremely tasty.  

Happy  Day!
~Barb~

KITCHEN TIP OF THE WEEK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Submitted by:  Heidi K. of Memphis, TN. 

When I make deviled eggs, I find it 
much easier to place the yolks and 
mayonnaise and whatever seasoning you 
like in a ziploc bag and mush it all 
together. I find it easier to break up 
the yolks and then you can snip off the 
corner of the bag and use it as a pastry 
bag to fill your eggs - No waste! 
It works great.
