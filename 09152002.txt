Dear Recipe Fan Chris,

September is National Chicken Month, so let's talk 
chicken this week...

Many people stick to the white meat only of chicken 
because of it's lower fat content.  But did you know
that 3 ounces of baked chicken drumstick with the 
skin removed has less total fat than 3 ounces of 
sirloin steak, beef tenderloin, pork chop, or salmon?  
It's true.  

You may want to consider your budget as well as fat 
content when choosing chicken.  Chicken Leg meat 
(thighs and drumsticks) are a great value today. That's 
because the demand for breast meat and wings is 
presently so high.  But a chicken is not produced one 
without the other. Consequently, chicken marketers are 
currently offering leg meat at very attractive prices. 

In some parts of the country, marketers are bringing 
innovative, tasty and convenient new products to your 
supermarket that use leg meat. These include: 

*  skinless, boneless thighs that can be used in place of 
boneless breast in many recipes. 
*  seasoned thigh meat on skewers, ready to go on 
the grill. 
*  marinated or seasoned leg meat strips, ready to use 
in fajitas or stir-fry recipes. 

Below are two great recipes using chicken.  Both work 
well with either white meat or chicken leg meat.  Enjoy!  

Happy  Day!
