Dear Recipe Fan Chris,

Potatoes are a nutritious food source.  They contain 
11-percent protein, 88-percent carbohydrate and only 
1-percent fat.  They are high in potassium, fiber and 
Vitamins B and C.

The versatile potato can be eaten as the main course, 
a side dish, a salad, a soup, a snack or in a casserole.  
They even can be used to make breads and rolls.  
Served for breakfast, lunch, dinner or snacks, potatoes 
can be served everyday for weeks and never eaten the
same way twice.  

Potatoes are actually a diet food.  It's all in how you 
prepare them, and mostly what you add to them that 
adds the calories.  Here's a couple ways to enjoy 
potatoes and stay on your diet too!

Scalloped Potatoes are easy to fix, low fat, low salt, 
satisfying, and big on taste.  Begin with 6 medium 
potatoes, sliced (peel if desired, but not necessary) .  
Add one medium onion, sliced thinly. Layer potatoes 
and onions in large casserole dish.  Combine 
2-Tablespoons flour, one-half teaspoon black pepper 
and sift over layered potatoes.  Warm 2 cups skim milk 
and pour over potatoes.  Bake at 350-degrees for 
1-1/2 hours.  

For a low fat, low salt and delicious potato salad, begin 
with 6-medium-sized red potatoes (boiled, cooled - 
peeled, if desired).  Cut into bits: 1 small onion, one stalk 
of celery, 1/2 green bell pepper, a few radishes. Then 
add a handful of minced fresh parsley.  For color and 
nutrition, add 4-oz. frozen peas which have been cooked 
and cooled.  

For a low-fat dressing, blend together 1-cup low-fat 
cottage cheese and 2-teaspoons prepared mustard.  
Chill for 4-hours.

Another delicious low-fat dressing alternative is to blend 
1/2 cup low-fat cottage cheese, 1-teaspoon prepared 
mustard 1/4 cup low-calorie Italian Dressing.  Fold into 
potato salad. Chill for 4-hours.

When you are in a hurry, bake a potato in the microwave.  
Pierce a potato several times to allow steam to escape. 
Place in microwave on high (100% power) until tender, 
turning potato over halfway. For medium-size potatoes 
(about 5 ounces), microwave 3 1/2 to 4 1/2 minutes. For 
larger potatoes (about 9 ounces), microwave 5 to 9 
minutes. 

Happy  Day!
