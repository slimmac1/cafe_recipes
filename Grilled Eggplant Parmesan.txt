Grilled Eggplant Parmesan
 
1 medium (about 1 1/2 pounds) eggplant, cut lengthwise into 4 slices 
1 tablespoon olive oil 
1 teaspoon olive oil 
1/2 teaspoon salt 
1/4 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper 
4 ounces mozzarella cheese, shredded (1 cup) 
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese 
1/2 cup (loosely packed) fresh basil leaves, sliced 
2 medium ripe tomatoes, each cut into 4 slices

Optional:  1 cup warm marinara sauce

1.  Prepare grill. Lightly brush eggplant slices with oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. In small bowl, mix mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, and basil; set aside. 

2.  Place eggplant slices on grill over medium heat. Cook 8 to 10 minutes, until tender and lightly browned, turning once. Top eggplant slices with tomato slices and cheese mixture. Cover grill and cook 1 to 2 minutes, until cheese melts and tomato slices are warm.

***I added a drizzle of marinara sauce over the top of each eggplant.  

***I also didn't have fresh basil, so just used a little bit of dried basil.
