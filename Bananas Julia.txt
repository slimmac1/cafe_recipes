DirectRecipes(tm) Weekly



Dear Subscriber,

When life hands you lemons, you don't have to make 
lemonade! 

Lemons and limes are fresh and plentiful right now.  
It's a great time to think Lemon Meringue Pie or maybe 
a Lemon Sauce for over sponge cake.    

For people who are looking to lessen the use of salt in 
their diet, you'll find lemon juice makes foods come alive 
and will obscure the lack of salt.   When cooking pasta 
without salt, squeeze lemon juice into the boiling water 
to add zip.  Lemons also can be used as a substitute 
for vinegar wherever delicacy is wanted.

Chad R. Wyatt of Yreka, CA shares his favorite way to 
dress up broccoli.  Prepare as you like; steamed or 
microwaved. Squeeze a fresh lemon over broccoli then 
sprinkle with parmesian cheese. You can bake in a 300 
degree oven for ten minutes if you like to toaste the cheese.  

If you want to add zest to stuffings, sauces, soups, meats 
or desserts, try grating the peel of lemons, limes, oranges.  
There is plenty of flavor in the oily based gratings, thus 
sparingly is best.  When grating, only use the colorful portion, 
the white beneath is bitter.   

Lemons are useful in many other ways as well.  While there 
is many more, here are a few that may be helpful to you:
* Clean copper with a paste of lemon juice and salt; rinse and 
polish dry.
* Rub hands with a lemon wedge to remove fish, onion and garlic 
odors.
* Shine piano keys or other ivory objects with half a lemon or a 
lemon-salt paste; rinse with a clean, wet cloth, then buff.
* Brighten hair with a strained lemon juice-warm water rinse; 
rinse again in clear water.   
* See Kitchen Tips of the Week for more uses of lemon juice.

And last, if you do want to make lemonade, microwave your 
lemons for 30 seconds before you squeeze them. You'll get a 
lot more juice! 

Happy Day!

"A simple and easy pie for family or guests."
Submitted by....Peggy Strom of Galveston, TX  

1 graham cracker pie shell (store bought works good)
1 can sweetened condensed milk (15-oz. size)
1/3 Cup lime or lemon juice 
1 Tablespoon grated lime or lemon juice 
1/4 teaspoon salt 

Stir until thickened.  The thickening results from the 
reaction of the milk and citrus juice.  Pour filling into 
crust.  Chill about 3 hours.

Garnish with whipped cream and shaved sweet 
chocolate.
