KITCHEN TIP OF THE WEEK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
During winter ice and snow storms it's a great idea to
be stocked up on lots of canned foods that you can just 
open and serve if the power goes off.  Don't forget a 
manual can opener!

RECIPE OF THE WEEK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Harvest Pumpkin-Pineapple Loaf 

Crushed pineapple adds moistness to this fall favorite 
while canned pumpkin provides an excellent source of 
vitamin A. 

Ingredients: 

No-stick cooking spray 
2 1/2 cups granulated sugar 
1/2 cup (1 stick) butter or margarine, softened 
1 can (15 ounces) pumpkin 
1 can (8 1/4 ounces) crushed pineapple in juice, undrained 
4 large eggs 
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 
2 teaspoons baking soda 
2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice 
1 teaspoon salt 
Powdered sugar (optional) 
Tip: If desired, walnuts may be added. Prepare recipe 
as directed, stirring in 1 cup coarsely chopped walnuts 
when adding dry ingredients. 

Preparation: 
Heat oven to 350° F. Lightly spray two 8 1/2 x 4 1/2-inch 
loaf pans with cooking spray. In mixer bowl, beat together 
sugar and butter until blended. Add pumpkin, pineapple 
and eggs; beat well. Set aside. In medium bowl, combine 
flour, baking soda, pumpkin pie spice and salt; add to 
pumpkin mixture, mixing until dry ingredients are just 
moistened. Divide batter into prepared pans; spread 
evenly. Bake 55 to 65 minutes or until wooden pick 
inserted in center comes out clean. Cool 5 minutes. 
Remove from pans to wire racks; cool completely. 
Lightly sprinkle powdered sugar over tops, if desired.
