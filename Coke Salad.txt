Dear slimmac1,

Tomorrow is President's Day.  Since this is an all-American day, it just
seems appropriate to think of apple pie (Abe Lincoln) or cherry pie
(George Washington).

Though no one remembers the genius who first invented pie, nobody ever
forgets the woman who bakes perfect pies.  Most of you probably can think
of a relative or friend who is noted for baking the best tasting and
flakiest pie crust.   A crisp, golden crust that literally melts in your
mouth.  No matter what the filling, it's the crust that makes a perfect
pie.

Today's world offers quickie methods of pie crust making.  Put all
ingredients into a food processor and whip together a great dough, roll
out and line pie plate.  Or even simpler, buy frozen pie crust, thaw and
unfold and line pie plate.  These crusts aren't bad, but do not match the
light, flakey made-with-your-own-hands pie crust.

For Apple or Cherry pie, use 2 to 3 cups canned cherries or apples between
double crusts.

For an ultra cherry pie, add 1 cup cherry cola with 2 tablespoons
quick-cooking tapioca.  Warm cherries, cola and tapioca until it begins to
thicken, then fill pie shell.  Lattice top pie crust to allow steam to
escape.  Bake in 450-degree oven for 10 minutes.  Reduce heat to
350-degrees and bake about 45 minutes or until golden brown.

For an ultra apple pie, add 2 teaspoons cinnamon, 1 teaspoon nutmeg, 2
tablespoons butter, 2 tablespoons sour cream, and if desired, one-half cup
raisins.   Mix together by hand and spread evenly in pie shell.  Cover
with top pie shell, and cut two 1-inch squares of pie shell out to allow
for steam to escape.  Bake same as above for ultra cherry pie.

Top with a dollop of vanilla ice cream.

For a lighter dessert, see our Recipe of the Week "Coke Salad" (below).

Happy Day!

              KITCHEN TIP OF THE WEEK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A fast easy way to pit cherries: hold the cherry 
between your thumb and index finger with stem 
end pointing towards a bowl and squeeze.
The pit should pop out with some juice. Be sure 
to catch the flavorful juice to use in your recipes.
