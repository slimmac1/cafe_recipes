Dear Recipe Fan Chris,

Shaving time from meal preparation is something I'm 
always looking to do.  When time is tight, grab your 
biggest skillet and begin to prepare dinner quick and 
easy.  Most skillet meals can be prepared from start to 
finish in a half hour or less.  Cleanup is easy too, since
you need one pan, plates and silverware.  

Your imagination works well in skillet meals.  So feel 
free to adjust my concoctions according to your own 
tastes.  A favorite in our household is what we call 
"Skillet Ham & Pasta".  In your large skillet, bring to a 
boil 1-can (14-1/2 oz.) of chicken broth.  Add 1-1/2 cups 
uncooked spiral pasta.  Cook, uncovered for about 10 
minutes or until tender.  Do not drain any remaining liquid.  
Stir in 1 can black beans, which have been drained.  Next 
add 1 cup frozen corn and 1 cup cubed cooked ham.  
Season with 1/8 teaspoon ground cumin and 1/4 teaspoon 
thyme, then salt and pepper to taste.  Cook for about 6-7 
minutes, then sprinkle 1/4 cup shredded cheese of your 
choice on top.  Cook one more minute, and your ready 
to serve.  

We love seafood in our household, particularly shrimp.  
If you do also, this skillet dish will be a favorite of yours.  
We call this one "Cheesy Shrimp Linguine".  Cook 8-oz. 
of linguine noodles according to package directions; set 
aside to keep warm in the hot water.  In your large skillet, 
saute about 1/2 cup chopped onions, 2 minced garlic cloves, 
2 teaspoons oregano in oil or butter, whatever your 
preference.  When the onions are transparent, gradually 
add 3/4 cup whipping cream intermittent with 3/4 cup 
shredded Swiss cheese and 3/4 cup shredded Parmesan 
cheese.  Cook only until cheese is melted, then add 1-pound 
cooked small shrimp.  (If you use frozen cooked shrimp, thaw 
before adding to skillet.)  Cook just until shrimp is hot. Drain 
your linguine and place in serving bowl.  Pour the  creamy 
cheese and shrimp topping over linguine.  Serve and enjoy.  
(P.S.  If you are watching your calories, or don't have 
whipping cream handy, you can easily substitute milk.)  

Happy Day!
