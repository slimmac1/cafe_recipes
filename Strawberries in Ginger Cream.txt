Dear slimmac1,

Aaahhhh..... the sweet, tantalizing taste of strawberries.  

Strawberries are unique as they are the only fruit with 
seeds on the outside.  The outside of an average sized 
strawberry has approximately 200 seeds.  The sweet berry 
is low in calories and chock full of Vitamin C. One-half 
cup of strawberries provides a full day's requirement of 
Vitamin C and has only 65 calories.

The best strawberries are the ones you pick yourself or 
buy from a local strawberry field.  The taste is sweetest 
when eaten within 2 days of picking.   Choose plump, bright 
red and fully ripe berries.  Strawberries do not ripen 
after they are picked.  Upon getting your berries home, cover
them loosely and store them in the coldest part of the 
refrigerator.  Do not wash berries first and do not remove 
the caps (stems) until just before using.  Do not crowd or 
squeeze the berries.

When you are ready to prepare the berries, put them 
carefully into a colander to wash.  Never run water over 
berries as this damages them.  Dip the colander in a pan 
of ice water, then gently move berries around to wash.  
Using ice water firms up the berries for easier handling.  
One by one, take berries from ice water and remove hull 
and stem.  Lay on paper toweling to dry.

There's endless ways to prepare strawberries.  In our 
featured Recipes of the Week, you will see our subscribers 
have shared four delicious ways to prepare this nutritious 
fruit.   Strawberries are just downright berry, berry good!

Happy Day!
~Barb~

        STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE TO DIE FOR

Bisquick drop biscuits
French vanilla ice cream
Fresh sliced strawberries
Fresh whipped cream 

Make the Bisquick drop biscuits as directed on the 
Bisquick package, BUT add 1 Tablespoon of sugar 
(or 2, if you like). Bake as directed.

While still warm, cut in half and put the bottom half 
in a bowl. Cover with fresh sliced strawberries.  
Add a scoop or two of French vanilla ice cream, then 
top with top layer of the biscuit.  Then cover
with more strawberries and top with whipped cream.   

Note:  I marinate 2-3 cups of strawberries in 4 
Tablespoons sugar in the refrigerator for a day or 
two - but this is not necessary.
