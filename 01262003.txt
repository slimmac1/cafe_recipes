Dear Recipe Fan Chris,

Need an idea for a change of pace meal that is 
oh-so-delicious?  

Most of you have had "spaghetti" with your favorite 
tomato sauce, ground beef, meat balls, etc.  Have you 
ever had Baked Spaghetti?  This cheesy dish puts a 
different spin on spaghetti.  And if you should have 
leftovers, they freeze well for a quick meal later.  

For the Recipe of the Week, we have "Best Ever 
Cheesy Biscuits" submitted by our DirectRecipes(tm)
subscriber, Dorothy Pearson.  These would be
wonderful with Baked Spaghetti.  

See below to plan tomorrow's dinner! 

Happy Day!
