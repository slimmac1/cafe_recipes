DirectRecipes(tm) Weekly

Dear Subscriber,

Let's talk salsa! 

The real flavors of traditional Mexican cooking are complex,
multi-layered, fresh and intense. If you are a do-it-yourself
kind of person, one who appreciates the fresh flavors of 
tomatoes, tomatillos and chiles, you may have been
hesitant about the salsas that line the shelves in most 
grocery stores. It is quite easy to get "burned" ~ not by 
overly hot chiles ~ but by glorified packaging and 
advertising. When the salsas aren't over cooked, they are 
usually heavy on the vinegar. Understanding what salsa is 
all about ~ more than just a party dip ~ will entice your taste 
buds and add variety to your meals. 

Rick Bayless, author of "Rick Bayless's Mexican Kitchen", 
has amassed a wealth of "artifact recipes". His salsas 
capture the exuberant regional flavors of Mexico. These 
recipes accentuate fresh natural ingredients, fire-roasted
to concentrate, sweeten and intensify natural flavors. 

Tomatillo Salsa is vibrantly green, tangy and aromatic. 
Jalapeño Salsa (this writer's personal favorite) is spicy
jalapeños which are crushed together with roasted garlic 
and fire-roasted ripe tomatoes. (medium heat) 
Chipotle Salsa Smoky-hot chipotle chiles are 
complemented  by zesty tomatillos and mellow roasted 
garlic. (Try it drizzled over scrambled eggs.) 
Frontera Salsa Sampler If you haven't tried any of the above 
salsas, you owe it to yourself to try this sampler of all three of 
the above, and ChefShop has created an exclusive offer to 
entice you! 

For the next ten days they will be offering their Frontera Salsa 
Trio at 20% off their regular retail price. This offer can only be 
found at: http://newsletter.directstuff.com/UM/T.asp?A2.3.82.4.336803

The El Paso Chile Company's rule of thumb is: "you can never 
go wrong consuming from the three food groups - Salsa, 
Snacks, and Margaritas"! 
Nopales Cactus Salsa is a medium hot blend of green New 
Mexican chiles, tomatillos, onions, jalapeno and Nopales 
cactus leaves. 


Last but not least, ChefShop.com offers two delicious salsas 
from Quinn, a company located in the Pacific Northwest. 
Chipotle Salsa is a kicky combination of vegetables and it's much
milder than the "hot" Frontera version. 
Peach Salsa Resplendent with ripe peaches, tomatoes, onions, 
and habeñeros, this sauce really belongs with cold meats and 
fish, or mixed into dressings.
