Dear slimmac1,

Valentine's Day makes one think of the heart.  While 
everyone will be sending heart-felt valentines and-or 
gifts to loved ones, we may want to think of sharing 
love in the form of food for the heart as well.

Moms - have you served oatmeal to your family lately?  
After all, oatmeal is one of the best ways to start your 
day.  Oatmeal actually removes cholesterol from your body.  
In fact, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted the 
first food-specific health claim to Quaker Oats for use on
oatmeal: "Soluble fiber from oatmeal in a diet low in 
saturated fat and cholesterol may reduce the risk of heart
disease."

C'mon along and read some warming and exciting ways that 
you can feed your family nutritious oatmeal wonderously.

Oatmeal adheres well to several different flavors.  You can 
take your already healthy breakfast and add fruit.  Add 
sliced strawberries (they will soon be in season), or peaches 
and blueberries are excellent within oatmeal also.  Dried 
fruits taste great too.  Banana chips, sun-dried cherries or 
cranberries with one teaspoon of brown sugar (16 calories).  
The fruits plump up and release their wonderful flavor.

In a hurry?  Don't have fresh, canned or dried fruits handy?   
Just use one-half water with one-half fruit juice to cook 
your oatmeal.  It's fast and adds flavor.   Or sprinkle your 
cooked oatmeal with toasted almonds. (Yummy!)

Anyone know a kid who doesn't like cookies?  Uh-huh - and 
oatmeal cookies are so easy to make.  Let the kids join in 
the fun too.   See Recipe of the Week below for an easy 
oatmeal cookie.

How many of you love homemade bread?  Make a heart-warming 
loaf of Oatmeal Raisin Bread for your loved one this 
Valentine's Day!   If grabbin' a quick muffin fits your 
lifestyle better, try Wholesome Apple Raisin Muffins.
