Dear slimmac1,

When the weather turns cold, one thinks of soups and chili 
as a warming food.

Chili is one of those meals that anything that goes into 
the pot sounds good at the time.  Have you ever put beer 
in your chili?  How about tequila?  Sound yucky?  Nope - 
it's actually really quite good with the right concoctions 
of ingredients.  (See the championship recipe below.)

Chili is best the second day.  It should also be cooked 
slow; simmered versus fast and quick.  Make a big pot as 
it freezes well for those nights you don't have time to 
prepare dinner.

Not only are the varieties of chili plentiful, but the 
uses are as well.  Chili can also be used on hot dogs, 
hamburgers, over potatoes, on tortillas and makes a great 
dip for chips of all kinds.

Next time that cold wind blows, think of hot chili for 
dinner.  Here's some tried and true chili recipes from 
our subscribers.

Happy Day!
