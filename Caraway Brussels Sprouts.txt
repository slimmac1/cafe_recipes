Dear slimmac1,

With the holidays just about over, many are now thinking 
diet, lower calories, light eating.  Here's some tips to 
help with your daily cooking.

Eating light begins with lowering fat content.  Many 
liquids can be used to replace the fat in cooking.  Water, 
defatted chicken stock, orange juice, vegetable stock, 
wine or sherry are some popular choices to saute'
ingredients.  For instance, try baking deskinned chicken 
in orange juice, seasoned with lemon pepper.  Yummy!

Seasoning is another clue to light eating.  Lighten up on 
the salt and add flavor.  Salt retains water in the body, 
thus pounds.  Use garlic powder (not garlic salt) and lemon 
pepper, dried or fresh herbs or even hot peppers, if you 
desire. Low fat foods can have big flavor if you learn
the aide of various spices.  Try toasting nuts and seeds, 
such as pine nuts and sesame seeds. A few of these tasty 
sprinkles on foods adds enormous flavor.

Use pureed vegetables as natural thickeners for sauces or 
soups.  Cooked potatoes make a good thickener for soups. 
A bit of corn starch added to liquids also thickens without 
added calories for things like gravy.

Try putting your meat of choice with some cubed potatoes, 
sliced carrots, some onion slices and fresh mushrooms 
into a square of aluminum foil. Bake for about 45 minutes 
at 350-degrees.  No additional fats needed, all flavors 
are blended for a delicious meal.

There are many tasty desserts or snacks that work in dieting.  
For instance, take a ripe banana and put it in the oven at 
350-degrees for 15 min.  Peel and serve topped with fat-free 
yogurt. Another idea is to bake some cored apples in apple 
cider and topped with cinnamon.

As we enter 2001 the entire DirectRecipes staff thanks our
