      ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
Cook's Tip: Beef tri-tip is a boneless roast from the 
bottom sirloin. Tri-tip roasts usually weigh about 
1-and one-half to 2 pounds and have a distinctive 
tri-angular shape.
...Gloria Bradley of Illinois - 1999 "Best of Beef" Winner
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Total Preparation and Cooking Time: 30 Minutes 

1 pkg (1 and one-half to 2 pounds) fully-cooked beef 
tri-tip roast
2 cans (approx. 8-oz. each) tropical fruit salad in 
light syrup
1 large orange
2 to 3 teaspoons spicy brown mustard
one-fourth to one-half teaspoon hot pepper sauce
Salt and pepper
one-half cup diced green bell pepper

1) Remove beef tri-tip roast from package; place in a 
microwave-safe dish. Transfer 3 to 4 tablespoons liquid 
from package to small saucepan; set aside. Discard any 
remaining liquid or reserve for other use. Cover roast and 
microwave on high 7 to 10 minutes or until heated through. 
Let stand, covered, 5 minutes.

2) Meanwhile drain fruit salad, reserving 3 tablespoons of 
the syrup. Cut up any large pieces of fruit; set aside. 
Grate 1 teaspoon peel from orange; set aside. Cut orange in 
half. Squeeze juice from ½ orange; peel and chop orange 
sections from remaining one-half.

3) Combine reserved syrup, orange juice, mustard, orange peel, 
pepper sauce, salt and pepper, as desired in medium bowl; 
whisk until blended. Measure one-fourth cup of the orange 
juice mixture; add to beef liquid in saucepan. Set aside. 
Add reserved fruit, chopped orange and bell pepper to remaining 
orange juice mixture in bowl; mix well. Cover and refrigerate.

4) Carve roast across the grain into thin slices. Bring mixture in
saucepan to a boil; remove from heat.

5) Arrange beef and fruit relish side-by-side on platter. Spoon 
hot sauce over beef, as desired. Garnish with orange slices, 
if desired.
