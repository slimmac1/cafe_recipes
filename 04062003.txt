Dear Recipe Fan Chris,

The Easter Bunny goes home, and what are you left with 
besides a few jelly beans and a lot of brightly colored Easter 
eggs? Most likely the kids eat the jelly beans, and leave it up 
to you to find a way to use several hard boiled eggs.  Here
are some ideas to help turn hard boiled eggs into delightful 
dishes. 

Make "Scotch Eggs" for a great breakfast treat.  (Dieters, 
close your eyes for this recipe!)  Peel and dry 6 hard boiled
eggs; set aside.  Get out 1-lb of your favorite pork sausage.  
(My preference is Jimmy Dean's hot variety.)  Divide the 
sausage into 6 equal portions; set aside.  Put about 1/2 cup 
of flour in another dish; set aside.  In yet another dish, 
combine 1 cup bread crumbs, 1-teaspoon salt, 2-teaspoons 
pepper, and 1-teaspoon paprika; set aside. 

Next take your thoroughly dried and peeled hard boil egg, 
and roll it in the flour.  Then take 1 portion of the sausage 
and wrap it completely around the egg.  Next take the 
sausage-wrapped egg and roll it in the bread crumb mixture.  
Do this with each of your 6 eggs.  Then fry this in about 
3-inches of cooking oil.  (I use olive oil, but you may use any 
vegetable oil of your choosing.)  Turn frequently until brown 
on all sides.  Drain on paper towel.  Serve with your favorite 
mustard.  Yummy!  

"Egg Salad" is an old stand-by to use up hard boiled eggs.  
Always good for sandwiches, but another excellent lunch is 
to take a tomato, slice it in half only 7/8th to the bottom, then 
in fourths, leaving the bottom intact and stuff with egg salad.  

"Deviled Eggs" are good anytime; snacks or with any meal.  
Everyone has their own recipe for this delightful dish, but here's 
one I get many compliments on.  Take 1-dozen hard boiled eggs, 
carefully slice lengthwise down the middle.  Pop out the yolk and 
set aside in a boil.  Save whites of eggs on a platter.  Mash the 
yolks, and add: 4-Tablespoons mayonnaise, 1/4 teaspoon dry 
mustard, 1-Tablespoon horseradish, salt and pepper to taste.  
Spoon a portion of the yolk mixture into each 1/2 of the white.  
Sprinkle with paprika.  Pretty and delicious!  

Following are a couple Easter recipes submitted by our 
subscribers. Our thanks to both Joanne and April.    

Happy Day!

Makes 6-Loaves

5 pounds flour 
1 pound butter or margarine -melted and cooled 
1 cup sugar 
2 dozen eggs, beaten 
1/2 level handful of salt 
1 package dry yeast in 1/4 cup warm water. 
1/2 cup lemon zest
12 colored eggs not cooked
colored candies to sprinkle

Mix dry ingredients. Make a hole in the middle of the flour 
mixture. Pour eggs, yeast mixture, melted butter into 
depression and mix to form a dough. If it is too dry, add 
a little water. Knead for 10 minutes. Form into a ball, place 
in a large bowl, cover and leave to rise over night in a 
warm place.

Uncover in the morning. Form into 6 equal parts. Divide 
each part into 3 more parts, braid the parts, and crimp the 
ends. Brush with egg wash, place 2 colored uncooked eggs 
on each loaf, sprinkle each loaf with colored candies. Place 
on greased cookie sheet. Cover and allow loaves to rise 
until double in size. Bake at 375 degrees to 400 degrees 
for 15 to 20 minutes. Remove when brown.

Rice Cake
~~~~~~~~~
This "cake" was an Easter tradition in our Polish family for 
years. This is the original recipe as passed down from three 
generations. If you like the taste of rice pudding, you will 
enjoy this, although the cake is much denser than pudding. 
Submitted by... April 
---------------

Make rice using 2 cups uncooked rice, 5 cups water and 
1 teaspoon salt. Refrigerate after cooled.  Once cooled, 
add 1/4 pound cream cheese and 1/4 pound butter.

In separate bowl, mix 2 eggs, 1/2 cup sugar, 1 cup milk 
and 1 cup cake flour. 

Mix with rice mixture and pour into 8 x 8 x 2 glass or 
Corningware pan. (I've had it prepared loaf style also.) 
Bake at 400 F for one hour. Let cool, then refrigerate. It 
is served in small pieces or slices as it is very dense. 
Enjoy!
