DirectRecipes(tm) Weekly


Dear Recipe Fan Chris,

In today's fast-paced lifestyles, we are always 
looking for easy preparation, yet something 
healthful, full of protein and also light on fat.  
Here's an idea you may not have thought about 
for awhile...

Go to your pantry and grab a can of salmon for 
dinner tonight.  It's amazing how quickly you can 
zap together a unique and delicious entree 
beginning with a can of salmon. Open a 15-oz 
can of salmon, drain juices. Put in bowl, mash 
with a fork, add two eggs, three-fourths cup 
bread crumbs and whatever spices you like. 
Lemon-pepper or Creole seasoning is good. 
Then make little patties while you get a pan or 
griddle hot. Spray hot frying pan with a cooking 
spray. Fry patty until each side is light golden 
brown. 

This same principle works well made into a 
salmon loaf as well. Use two 15-oz. cans of 
salmon, mash salmon with fork, add 3 eggs, 
3 cup of crushed cracker crumbs or bread 
crumbs, 1/2 cup milk, chopped onions or maybe 
chopped green pepper. Bake in 350-degree 
oven for 45 minutes. Or if you use your slow 
cooker, set temperature on medium-high and 
cook for about 2 hours.

Cooking outdoors is fun in the summertime. 
Lay heavy duty aluminum foil over the grates of 
the grill and cook your salmon patties until light 
golden brown. This would go especially well 
with our featured recipe this week of 
"Cheesiest Grilled Potatoes".

Happy  Day!

To remove crayon marks from your walls... 
first heat the area with a hair dryer for a few 
seconds.  Then wipe with a soft cloth.  The 
wax of the crayon melts and will wipe right off.
