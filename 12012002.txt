1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt 
1 to 2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips

Beat together butter, shortening and peanut butter at 
medium speed until blended, about 2 minutes.  Gradually 
add sugars, beating until light and fluffy;about 4 minutes.  
Beat in eggs, one at a time; beat well after each addition.  

Whisk together flour, baking soda and salt.  Beat into 
dough until blended.  Stir in chocolate chips and peanuts.

Peanut Sitting Pretties

Christmas would be the same for my family without these. 
My brother just loves them and puts a whole one in his 
mouth at a time!  
Submitted by... Jennifer
~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
1/2 cup softened butter
1/4 cup brown sugar
One egg, separated
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
1 cup flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
Finely chopped nuts
One can vanilla frosting
M & M's Peanut Candies 

Blend butter and brown sugar. Add yolk and vanilla. 
Blend flour and salt into bowl. Chill dough one hour. 

Roll dough into 1-inch balls. Dip into slightly beaten egg 
white. Roll in nuts. Place 1-inch apart on ungreased cookie 
sheet. Bake at 350-degrees, five minutes. Remove from 
oven and place a thumbprint indention in the middle of 
each cookie. The cookies are very hot - if you wish, use 
the back of a teaspoon or a clean thimble, upside down. 
Bake another five minutes. Place on cooling rack and 
cool completely. 

Fill with frosting and decorate with red and green M & M 
Peanut Candies. I usually place four on each cookie, 
alternating a green and red candy.
