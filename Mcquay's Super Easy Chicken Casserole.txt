Super Easy Chicken "Casserole"  - Chris McQuay
(15-20 minute prep time)

Ingredients:
1 package of Knorr's Pasta Sides Alfredo
1 cup diced chicken breast
1 cup frozen corn (or other vegetable)
Optional:
1 Tablespoon of Garlic powder
2 Tablespoons of ground Parmesian Cheese 
Dash of salt and pepper

Directions:
Prepare the pasta according to the directions on the package. Two minutes before the noodles are done, add the corn. 
Heat some oil in a non-stick skillet over medium heat and fry the diced chicken. Or, if you prefer, steam-cook the chicken in
your microwave. Once that's finished, put the chicken in with the pasta and corn. Season to taste.

Makes a great 1-dish meal for 3-4 people!  If you enjoy this, try variations of Pasta flavors and/or use other veggies.
