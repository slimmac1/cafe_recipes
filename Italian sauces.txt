DirectRecipes(tm) Weekly

Dear Subscriber,

Salute Italia!

The romantic dialect of Italians along with their hand gestures as they
speak make them ever interesting to be around.  Besides the language,
Italy brings us fabulous cuisine.  

There are several Italian sauces, most flavored with garlic.  Keep in
mind that too much garlic will overpower other flavors.

Marinara (mariner's style) sauce, made with fresh tomatoes and herbs is
so called because it was made by fishermen's wives who awaited their
husbands' return with the catch-of-the-day which was added to the
already prepared sauce. 

Tomatoes are naturally a bit acidic. To neutralize the acidity in your
sauces, add a spoonful of milk or sugar. 

Ricotta cheese is widely used in Italian cooking in everything from
appetizers to desserts.  It is a very soft, low-fat cheese that is
actually a by-product of cheese making because it is made from the whey
that has been separated from the curd in processing. 

To make a great spread for toast, mix 1 cup of ricotta cheese with 2
Tablespoons of honey, and one teaspoon of cinnamon.  

Get your taste buds ready because the Recipes of the Week are Baked Ziti
and Potato Gnocchi, two traditional Italian dishes.   
Bon Apetite~~  

Happy Day!

When working with garlic, remember that washing your 
hands in cold water will help remove the smell, hot 
water will seal it in.

*Baked Ziti*  
~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
Submitted by.....Ruben Benegas of Riverside, CA   
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1 cup spaghetti sauce  <see recipe below>
3/4 cup Ricotta cheese (I use fat-free)
1/2 cup shredded parmesan and/or mozzarella cheese 
......(I like a mixture of the two; I also use fat-free) 

Preheat oven to 325-degrees. (I've used a toaster oven for this 
before, but you'll have to set the temp lower -- around 200 -- so 
the cheese on top doesn't burn). 

Cook ziti in boiling water just until tender, drain & put back into the
pot. Using a small dish, spoon in enough sauce to cover the bottom of
the dish (around 3 Tablespoons). Combine well the rest of the sauce, the
ricotta cheese & 1 Tablespoon of the shredded cheese with the ziti.
Spoon the ziti mixture into the dish, mashing it down a little, top with
the rest of the cheese, & bake it about 20 minutes, until entire dish is
bubbly & cheese is melted. Serve with a green salad & hot bread.

My Ex-Mother-In-Law's Spaghetti Sauce (I've found none better) 
1 Tablespoon olive oil
1 Tablespoon garlic powder (or more to your personal preference)
1 14-1/2 oz can tomato sauce
1 14-1/2 oz can tomato puree
1 small can tomato paste (I believe it's around 7 oz)
1 Tablespoon sugar
Salt, pepper, oregano, basil
1 small onion, peeled
3 Italian sausage links (leave out if you prefer vegetarian sauce) 

Over medium heat in a heavy saucepan, brown the garlic powder in 
the olive oil -- this is the secret to great-tasting sauce! This happens
rather quickly, so don't let the garlic burn. Add the sauce, puree and
paste, then using the paste can, add 1 can of water. Add the sugar &
spices to your taste, then add the whole onion & sausages.

Cover, turn the heat to low & let simmer at least 4 - 5 hours, stirring
occasionally. If desired, you can cut up the onion & sausages into the
sauce after it's done, but since my daughter doesn't like onions, I
don't.

Potato Gnocchi
~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
Submitted by..... Verna Speverok of Apache Junction, AZ  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
5 1/2 cups mashed potatoes (about 3 pounds of raw potatoes) 
3/4 cup flour  (more or less)
5 egg yolks 
1/8 teaspoon nutmeg 
1 teaspoon salt 
White pepper; to taste 
1/3 cup olive oil

Place potatoes and egg yolks in bowl; mix well. Add nutmeg, salt, pepper
and about 1/2 cup of flour. Knead together and add the remainder of the
flour if necessary, bit by bit, kneading until a slightly ticky
consistency is attained. Lightly dust a work surface with flour.

Form the dough into sausage-like rolls about the thickness of your
thumb. Cut into pieces about 1-inch in length. Using a fork, flatten the
pieces so that the tines leave an imprint in the gnocchi. Keep a glass
of water nearby to clean the fork.

Meanwhile, fill a 3-quart pot with salted water and bring to a boil.
Drop the gnocchi into the boiling water, about 16 to 18 at a time. They
will sink to the bottom but will rise to the surface after a minute or
so. After they rise to the top, remove with a slotted spoon to a
colander. Sprinkle with a little olive oil, mix gently and transfer to a
heated platter.

Note:  These also can be rolled into a ball about the size of a nut.  

Sprinkle with olive oil and shake parmesan cheese over the top.  
Serve the gnocchi as a side accompaniment to roast meat or poultry.
