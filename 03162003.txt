Dear Recipe Fan Chris,

It's sometimes a challenge to disguise leftovers into a 
new, fresh meal, but it surely can be done.  Surprisingly 
sometimes the second-time-around dinner is even better 
than the original entree. Here's some tricks to stick up 
your apron sleeve for when you get tired of looking at 
leftovers.   

Leftover chili ~ First, this is excellent over a baked potato; 
served with side dish of peaches and cottage cheese.  
Another delicious way to use leftover chili is to spoon it 
into a large tortilla shell, roll up and place seam down on 
a baking sheet and cover with shredded cheese, then 
bake until the cheese melts and chili is hot.  

Leftover beef roast ~ If your roast is not in gravy, make a 
package gravy.  Then slice your leftover beef into the gravy, 
add a tablespoon or two of sour cream, then serve over any 
bread of choice for hot beef and gravy.  This is good with 
mashed potatoes and a side of mixed veggies.  Another 
idea is to cube your leftover beef and slide onto a skewer 
intermingled with your choice of mushrooms, tomatoes, bell 
pepper, onions, olives, radishes, celery, etc.  Drizzle with 
any Italian dressing.  This is delicious served with buttered 
cabbage as a side dish.  

Leftover Scalloped Potatoes and Ham ~ Make a 
heartwarming soup by placing your leftovers in a pan.  
Depending on the amount you have leftover, add milk and 
chicken broth to make a soupy, yet somewhat thick mixture.  
Grate a carrot into the broth, and simmer until heated through.  
Warning, this may turn out to taste better than the original 
meal. 

Leftover Rice ~ Make porcupine meat balls.  Start with fresh 
ground beef, add leftover rice and an egg.  Then form into 
balls.  Bake in 350-degree oven for about 30 minutes.  
Serve with roasted vegetables and some hot garlic bread.    

Leftover ham, turkey or chicken ~ can easily be turned in 
ham salad, turkey salad, or chicken salad for sandwiches.  
Finely chop or grind the meat, add mayonnaise or Miracle 
Whip, whatever your preference.  Then add pickles, relish, 
onions, celery, or chopped hot peppers, if you like them.  
These salad mixes are good on any variety of breads.    

Happy Day!
