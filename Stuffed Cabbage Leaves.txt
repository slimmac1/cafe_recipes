Dear Subscriber,

Do you...Live to eat....or Eat to live.....?     

People are beginning to be more concious of their 
eating habits today.  Some, such as diabetics, are 
forced to eat low fat, less salt and sugar and 
controlled portions.   This style of eating is healthy 
for everyone, not just diabetics, and more people 
are becoming ever-so aware of their food intake as 
well as the process of preparation.   

Many of our subscribers have asked for "easy" healthy 
and diabetic recipes. Here's some tasty and simple 
ideas following these guidelines.

Fresh vegetables are always acceptable eating and 
summertime offers us the best.  Take some fresh deep 
green steamed asparagus, sprinkle with sesame seeds.   
Another colorful and delicious combo is fresh snap 
beans, steamed with crisp yellow bell pepper julienne 
strips. Combine 2-Tablespoons olive oil, 2-Tablespoons 
balsamic vinegar and 2-Tablespoons water.  Sprinkle 
some fresh basil over vegies, then drizzle the dressing 
over top.  Yummy!

Corn-on-the-cob made on the grill is excellent.  Peel 
back the husks.  Do not remove husks but discard the 
silk.  Spray with a (fat-free) butter-flavored spray, then 
sprinkle on some chili powder!  Yeah, really - it's delicious!  
Replace the husks and wrap individual cobs in heavy duty 
aluminum foil.  Grill approximately 25 minutes.

A simple entree is any white fish (hake is good).  Sprinkle 
your white fish fillet with lemon-pepper seasoning, broil 
until it flakes when you touch it with a fork.   

Turkey is a low fat and easy food to prepare.  What's nice 
about turkey is that you can make the dinner feast, but then 
freeze portions of left over turkey and use for several other 
combinations of low-fat lunches and dinners.  

For dessert, section some pears, sprinkle with a bit of 
cinnamon and pop in the microwave for about a minute.   
This is good done with apples as well, but apples need 
a longer time in micro.  Cantaloupe is good this time of 
year.  Add a scoop of yogurt for a terrific dessert.

Eat to live!

Happy Day!

KITCHEN HINT

To slice corn kernels from the cob, use the center
"funnel" of a bundt pan to steady the cob while you 
slice off the kernels. The severed kernels fall neatly
into the bowl of the pan.

                 *Stuffed Cabbage Leaves*  
                 ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
I make this in the morning and when I get home from work,
it's ready to eat....Submitted by...Bea Moseley of Seattle, WA.  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
12 to 14 Large green cabbage leaves 
1-1/4 lb. ground turkey breast
1/4 cup egg substitute  
1 small onion (minced)
1 garlic clove (minced)
1 Granny Smith apple (chopped)
1 cup cooked rice
1 Tablespoon dillweed
2 Tablespoons parsley (fresh or flakes)
Pepper (to taste)

Cooking Sauce   
1 Tablespoon olive oil
2 onions (sliced thinly)
1 28-oz. can crushed tomatoes (no-salt added)
3 Tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1 Tablespoon paprika
1 teaspoon Worchestershire sauce  

Blanch cabbage leaves in boiling water for 3 minutes. 
Drain and refresh under running cold water to stop the 
cooking process. Drain again on paper towels and set 
aside. 

In a large bowl, combine turkey breast, egg substitute, 
onion, garlic, apple, cooked rice, dill weed, parsley, and 
pepper. Mix well. 

Place the cabbage leaves on a work surface. Divide the 
filling equally between the cabbage leaves, putting about 
1/4 cup of the turkey-rice mixture at the bottom of each 
cabbage leaf and roll up, folding in the bottom and sides 
to enclose the filling. Set filled leaves aside. 

In a large nonstick skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. 
Add the onion and garlic; sauté until onions are limp, 
about 4 minutes. Stir in remaining sauce ingredients and 
cook, uncovered, for another 5 minutes. Stir occasionally. 

Place half of the sauce in the bottom of a 4-quart or larger 
slow-cooker. Arrange filled cabbage leaves, seam side 
down, on top of the sauce, making several layers. Spoon 
the remaining sauce over the cabbage rolls. Do not stir. 

Cover and cook on LOW for 7 to 9 hours, or on HIGH for 
3-1/2 to 4 hours.   
 
To serve, transfer cabbage rolls to a large serving platter 
and top with sauce. Serve at once.
