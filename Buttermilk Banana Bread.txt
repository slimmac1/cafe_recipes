    1 cup all-purpose Flour
    1/2 cup granulated Sugar

    Grease and flour a loaf pan.
    In a large mixing bowl combine the bananas, applesauce and egg; set aside.

    Add the dry mixture to the banana blend alternately with the buttermilk.
    Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and bake for 45 to 55 minutes. The loaf is done when a toothpick/butterknife inserted in the middle of the loaf comes out clean.
