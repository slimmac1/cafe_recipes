Dear Recipe Fan Chris,

Nothing says "You are sweet" better than something 
sweet to eat.  There's no better time than Valentine's 
Day to make something sweet for your sweetie!  

There is oodles of recipes for cakes, truffles and tarts 
that adhere well to Valentine's Day.  The one that always 
most comes to mind is the old, old recipe called Red 
Velvet Cake.  The cake can be made from scratch (as 
in the 'Recipe of the Week' below) or merely eliminate 
the dry ingredients and start with any white cake mix. 

A few years ago a recipe of mine was published in a 
major recipe magazine.  I always think of it around 
Valentine's Day because it is so pretty.  If you have a 
pretty clear glass or crystal trifle or bowl, it will look too 
pretty to eat.  And you'll love how easy it is to make.  

----------
Cherry Angel Trifle  

1 pkg sugar-free cherry gelatin
3/4 cup boiling water 
1 prepared Angel Food cake (torn into 1-inch cubes)
1 can (approx 20-oz) light cherry pie filling
1 carton (8-oz) Fat-Free Cool Whip 

Dissolve gelatin in water; refrigerate for 15 min. Place 
half of the cake cubes in 3-qt trifle or clear glass serving 
bowl; top with half of the gelatin and pie filling.  Repeat 
layers. Top with whipped cream. Refrigerate 1-hour.
-----------

LOVE is often a main ingredient in homemade sweet 
treats.  Those dear to you are sure to be pleased when 
you prepare a luscious dessert just for them. 

Happy Valentine's Day!
~ Barb ~
