KITCHEN TIP OF THE WEEK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Storing Honey: If honey is tightly sealed it can be stored 
for years. If it begins to crystallize after opening it can be 
brought back to the proper consistency by heating in a 
microwave or by putting the jar in a bowl of warm water 
and then stirring.

Impossibly Easy Lasagna Pie   

Here is my favorite, all that you have to add is a green 
salad. I have the Bisquick Cookbook, with all the 
Impossible Pies in it. But my favorite is the Lasagna. 
This recipe is a little different than when it first came 
out, because back then we did not have the 
thick-and-chunky pasta sauce, back then it was just 
the one kind of sauce.

1 pound ground beef
1/2 cup thick-and-chunky tomato pasta sauce
3 Tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1 Tablespoon milk
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup shredded mozzarella (4 ounces)
1/2 cup Original Bisquick 
1 cup milk
2 eggs

Heat oven to 400. Grease pie plate, 9x1 1/4 inches. 
Cook beef in 10-inch skillet over medium heat, stirring 
occasionally, until brown; drain. Stir in pasta sauce, 
heat until bubbly.

Mix ricotta cheese, Parmesan cheese, 1-Tablespoon 
milk and the salt. Spread half of the beef mixture in pie 
plate. Drop cheese mixture by spoonfuls onto beef mixture. 
Sprinkle with 1/2 cup of the Mozzarella cheese. Top with 
remaining beef mixture. Stir Bisquick, 1 cup milk and the
eggs until blended. Pour into pie plate.

Bake 30 to 35 minutes or until knife inserted in center 
comes out clean. Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup 
mozzarella cheese. Bake 2 to 3 minutes or until cheese 
is melted. Let stand 5 minutes before serving.
