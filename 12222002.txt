Dear Recipe Fan Chris,

Christmas is upon us, and you haven't thought of
Christmas dinner? Well, here's some ideas you still
have time to whip together.  Traditionally, ham or
turkey is the main dish.  You'll probably want a pretty
red and/or green jello salad to brighten the table
as well.

A delightfully pretty and very easy jello salad is to
make one small box of cherry jello as per box directions.
Refrigerate about 1-1/2 hours, or until slightly thickened.
Add 1 can drained fruit cocktail.  In another bowl, make
small box of lime jello as per box directions.  Refrigerate
this one until jello jiggles slightly in the middle when
shaking it.  (about 3 hours.)  Put lime jello into your mixer,
add an 8-oz container of cool whip.  Mix together.  Green
chunks of lime jello appear between the cool whip,
making a pretty topping for your cherry jello.  Combine
in a mold; red on bottom, green on top, or individual
servings.

For your vegetable, make an inviting green and white
broccoli and cauliflower combination.  Place fresh
washed fresh broccoli in a microwaveable bowl; cover.
Microwave on high for 3-minutes.  Do the same with
fresh cauliflower.  Combine in a pretty serving dish by
piling broccoli in the middle with cauliflower around edge,
or vice-versa.  If you wish, you can mix 2 tablespoons
butter or margarine with 3-oz. Cheddar cheese and
3-oz. Monterey Jack cheese, melt in microwave; then
dribble over the top of veggies.

For something different at your Christmas dinner, try
ricing your potatoes versus mashing them.  Riced
potatoes are as comforting as mashed, but far lighter.
When you put spuds through a potato ricer it adds an
incredible amount of airy lightness to the mix.  You can
also put the whole dish of riced potatoes under a hot
broiler for a few seconds so the very top layer of potato
becomes slightly brown and crispy.

Add a Snowy White Rum Cake for dessert, which is
our Recipe of the Week (see below).

Merry Christmas from the entire staff at

Happy  Day!
