DirectRecipes(tm) Weekly



Dear Subscriber,

With the July heat, many are interested in eating
less, eating light.  A salad, a sandwich or even just
grabbing hor 'doeuvres or "canapes" and tea
sandwiches become appealing eating. Canapes can
become interesting and fullfilling lunch, brunch and
yes - even dinner on a hot muggy summer night.

A canape begins with smaller piece of bread, cracker
or pastry component.  There is a bottom to this
sandwich, but most times, no top.  The appetizing
part is generally the middle.

Start with bread of your choice.  Trim the crusts or
even cut the bread using a cookie cutter for
interesting shapes.  You can even find various
breads at the grocers called Cocktail breads that
are sliced specifically for canapes.

Now let your imagination run wild.  Whatever
sounds good on these mini-sandwiches is how to
build them.  Be sure to check the fridge for leftovers.
Many times, the leftover turkey, ham or even baked
beans make great canapes.  Take some
pumpernickle bread, spread a teaspoon full of baked
beans on top with a small slice of onion.

Try ham salad, chicken salad, or tuna salad as a
base for your canapy, adding a pickle or olive slice
is good.  Even a chunk of pineapple is good atop
this canape.

Cream cheese, cottage cheese, various sliced
cheeses add appeal to several ingredients.  Even
peanut butter and jelly are great on canapes.  The
kids will think it's great and served with an ice
cream shake alongside will make this the hit meal
of the week.

Happy Day!
