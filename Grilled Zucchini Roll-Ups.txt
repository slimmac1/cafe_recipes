Grilled Zucchini Roll-Ups

2 large zucchini, cut lengthwise into strips 1/4 inch thick
1 red bell pepper, seeded and cut into quarters
2 T extra virgin olive oil, divided
4 oz cream cheese
1 T finely chopped basil
1/2 T chopped chives
1 tsp chopped parsley
2 tsp balsamic vinegar

1. Preheat grill to medium heat. Brush both sides of the zucchini and bell pepper quarters with 1 T of the olive oil. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

2. Combine cream cheese, basil, chives and parsley in a small bowl and mix with a wooden spoon until the herbs are fully incorporated into the cream cheese.

3. Place zucchini and bell pepper on grill. Grill 1-5 minutes per side or until soft. Remove from grill and slice bell pepper into 1/4 inch strips, and then cut into pieces about 1 inch in length.

4. Place 1 tsp of the cream cheese mixture about 1/2 inch from one end of each zucchini strip. (Cover remaining zucchini with foil so they stay warm.) Top each with a few slices of bell pepper, and gently roll up. Place on a serving platter with the seam side down. Repeat with remaining ingredients. Drizzle with balsamic vinegar and remaining tablespoon of oil and serve immediately. (If rolls have cooled before serving, try wrapping them in foil and placing them on the grill for a few minutes to re-warm.)

Makes 12-16 roll-ups.
