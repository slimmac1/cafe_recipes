DirectRecipes(tm) Weekly


Dear Recipe Fan Chris,

Keeping the house cool during those summer 
months and still being able to cook meals for 
your family is sometimes a challenge.  Now is 
the time to dust off that crock pot or slow cooker 
you have buried in the cupboards or pantry.

Crock pot cooking is a wonderful time saver. 
Put everything in the pot, set the temperature 
and come back hours later to tantalizing aroma 
and dinner waiting to be put on the table. From 
chili to pot roast to beef stroganoff; all do well by 
the slow cooking method.   This method of 
cooking is wonderful to tenderize meat as well.  

For those that love liver and onions, there is no 
better way to cook this meal.  Coat slow cooker 
with thin coat of oil, add liver slices which have 
been dipped in flour into the pot.  (Salt and pepper 
to taste.)  Add lots and lots of onion slices - at 
least 3 medium onions sliced. Add one cup of 
water. Set slow cooker to low.  Come back many 
hours later to your delicious tender entree.  

Some vegetables are best cooked in slow cookers 
and crock pots as well. Butternut squash, does well 
by this cooking method. Cut the peeled and seeded 
squash into chunks, add 3 cored, peeled and sliced 
apples, 1 Tablespoon lemon juice, 1 teaspoon 
cinnamon, 1 Tablespoon brown sugar and 1/2 cup 
apple juice. Just toss all ingredients into crock pot or 
slow cooker. Cook for about 3-hours on medium 
setting or until squash is fork-tender. Yummy! 

If any of our subscribers would like to share their 
favorite crock pot or slow cooker recipes, we'll be 
glad to put them in this newsletter throughout our 
summer weekly issues.  Send your recipes to  
barb@directstuff.com

Happy  Day!

KITCHEN TIP OF THE WEEK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Submitted by... Sharon Halley of Desoto, MO

For something fast, I make extra food and I put 
the leftovers in divided plastic ware for TV dinners; 
then freeze.  When you don't feel like cooking, just 
take a dinner out of the freezer and you have a 
good home cooked meal in just a few minutes.  
Do this each time you cook and you'll have several 
choices from which to choose.
