Directions
Separate crescent rolls. Combine apples, brown sugar, flour, cinnamon & nutmeg. 
Evenly divide apple mixture onto 8 rolls. Drizzle melted butter over apples, 
saving enough to brush on top of rolls. Fold dough over top of apples, pinching 
up sides as best as possible (there will be openings on sides). Brush with 
remaining butter and sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar. Bake at 400 degrees for 
about 12 minutes or until rolls are golden. Serve warm.
