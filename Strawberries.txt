Dear Subscriber,

Strawberries are berry, berry good!

Most people eat strawberries because they are sweet and 
delicious.  Many are not even aware that great nutrition
is packed into each and every strawberry.   For instance, 
eight strawberries have more Vitamin C than an orange,  
and 1/2 cup of fresh strawberries is only 37 calories.

It's sometimes difficult to decide how many berries you 
need in a recipe.  A general rule of thumb is a pint box 
of medium sized berries will yield two (2) cups of 
strawberries or one (1) cup crushed or pureed.

Strawberrries are at their best eating as soon after 
picking as possible.  If you need to refrigerate for a 
day or two, do not wash them first.  Store uncovered 
loosely in refrigerator. Since strawberries absorb water, 
you would want to quickly wash them; do not soak them in 
a pan of water. Do not rub or bruise them when washing. 
Remove hulls after washing.

Freezing fresh strawberries without sugar is simple.  The 
first  method is to place the berries on flat trays in a 
single layer, well spaced out, and put into the coldest 
part of the freezer (the colder the better). Choose firm, 
ripe berries; wash in ice water before hulling. Carefully 
drain well on several layers of paper towels first. Then 
store in large freezer bags, or even better, vacuum seal 
them (after thoroughly frozen) if you have a vacuum sealer.

The second method is to fill freezer containers with 
prepared, sliced berries to within 1/2-inch of top. 
Combine 4 cups cold water with 1-Tablespoon lemon or lime 
juice and pour over berries before freezing.

You'll find some scrumptious ways of using strawberries 
in Recipes of the Week below.

Happy Day!

*Strawberries in Ginger Cream*
~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
I won first place in a Bake-Off that we had here in 
Flint 3 years ago. I won a bread machine. And I had 
this recipe published in a cookbook. I got the idea 
while I was in Jamaica. I hope you all enjoy it!
