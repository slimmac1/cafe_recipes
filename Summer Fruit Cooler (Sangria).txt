RECIPE OF THE WEEK

Summer Fruit Cooler (or Sangria)

All sorts of canned fruits make wonderfully refreshing coolers. 
The beauty of these refreshing beverages is the real fruit flavor 
without any of the fuss of peeling, pitting, or sprinkling with 
lemon juice to prevent discoloration. All the work has been 
done for you, so you can simply sit back on the porch rocker 
and enjoy.

Ingredients:
2 cans (16 ounces each) sliced or halved apricots, peaches, 
   pears, whole plums, pineapple chunks or fruit cocktail, 
   packed in lite syrup or juice
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
4 cups sparkling white wine or club soda
Ice cubes
Mint sprigs or edible flowers, such as nasturtiums, optional 

Preparation: 
Drain the fruit, reserving 1 cup of the syrup or juice. (Plums 
must be pitted.) If desired, cut and set aside 8 thin slices of 
fruit for garnish. In a blender or food processor, purée the fruit 
with the reserved syrup and the lemon juice. Use immediately 
or chill until ready to use, up to 8 hours. 

To assemble the drinks, pour 1/2 cup of the fruit base into 
each of 8 tall glasses. Gently stir in ½ cup of the wine or soda, 
then fill the glass with ice cubes. Garnish with reserved fruit and 
mint sprigs or flower blossoms, if desired. Serve immediately. 

Note: This is a barely sweet beverage for sipping by itself or 
before dinner. If you want to turn it into a dessert “Fruit Float,” 
use ginger ale or 7-up instead of the club soda and top off with 
a scoop of ice cream or sherbet. 

Preparation Time: 10 minutes 
Servings: 8
