DirectRecipes(tm) Weekly

Dear Subscriber,

Broccoli -- one either loves it or hates it. 

Whether you like it or not, broccoli is good for you.  It is 
a member of the cabbage family and contains high amounts of 
Vitamins A and C.  

Look for fresh green broccoli with firm, compact clusters of 
flower buds, with 
none opened enough to show the bright yellow flower. Bud 
clusters should be dark green, or even green with a purplish 
cast, depending on the variety. 

Did you know the stem or stalk of the broccoli is delicious?  
Probably like me, you've always chopped that off and tossed 
it away, never giving a second thought about it.  Recently I 
learned that it is one of the most nutritious and delicious 
parts of the vegetable.  Simply peel the outer skin around 
this heart of the broccoli, slice as you would carrot sticks, 
then steam with the rest of your broccoli.  It's delicious cold 
or hot and makes a great snack to munch on.  You could also chop 
this heart of broccoli and add it to salads or a pasta dish.   

Broccoli is easy to microwave.  Wash and cut - put in glass bowl, 
cover with plastic wrap, slice two small holes in plastic wrap.  
Cook for 2-3 minutes, depending on your microwave.  

Put broccoli on your shopping list this week and enjoy one of the 
featured Recipes of the Week below. 

Happy Day!

*Broccoli and Bacon Salad*
~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
I thought I'd send in this recipe for a summer salad. I got this recipe
from 
one of those great cookbooks that local communities have printed as 
fund raisers. I don't know where this one originates from, but it's
delicious!

My favorite way to dress up broccoli...

Prepare as you like. Steamed or microwaved. 

Squeeze a fresh lemon over broccoli then sprinkle with 
parmesan cheese. You can bake in a 300 degree oven for 
10 minutes if you like to toast the cheese.
