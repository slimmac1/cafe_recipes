Spaghetti with garlic, olive oil and hot pepper

    1 lb. spaghetti
    6 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
    2-3 garlic cloves, sliced
    2 fresh or dried small red chili peppers, seeded and shredded
    1 Tbsp. finely chopped flat-leaf parsley
    Salt 

    In a large pot, bring 6 qt. of water to a rolling boil over high heat. Add 3 tbsp. salt and spaghetti, stirring to prevent pasta from sticking. Cook until tender but firm to bite, “al dente”. Drain thoroughly.
    WHILE the spaghetti is cooking, into a saute pan (large enough hold pasta) add olive oil, garlic and pepper. Cook over low-med heat until garlic starts to turn golden (do not allow to burn), approx 2-3 mins.
    Transfer drained spaghetti into pan with oil. Toss together and and cover. Let rest off heat for 1-2 minutes to allow pasta to absorb sauce. Add parsley, toss again and serve immediately.

Thoughts and Ideas

If You don´t like that much garlic, just smash the garlic cloves a bit and fry them with the chili peppers, then remove them.
