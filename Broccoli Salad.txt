Broccoli Salad

Yield: 8 to 10 servings

Prep Time: 20 minutes

2 heads broccoli
½ pound bacon, cooked and crumbled
8 ounces cubed cheddar cheese
1 small onion, finely chopped
1 cup mayonnaise
½ cup granulated sugar
3 tablespoons white vinegar

1. Trim the florets off of the broccoli, cutting large pieces into bite-size pieces,
   and rinse in a colander.
2. Combine the broccoli, bacon, cheese and onion in a large mixing bowl.
3. In a medium bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, sugar and vinegar. Pour the 
   dressing over the broccoli mixture and stir until everything is evenly coated.
4. The broccoli salad can be served immediately, but it tastes even better if you 
   cover it and refrigerate it for an hour or two before serving. Leftovers the 
   next day are even better! :)
