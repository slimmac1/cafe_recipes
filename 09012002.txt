Dear Recipe Fan Chris,

Ever make an Ice Cream Cake Roll?  It is easy to do
if you know a few simple tricks.

Start with a regular boxed chocolate cake; follow
directions on box except add one extra egg.  Bake
your cake in a cookie sheet which has first been lined
with waxed paper (approx. 15-inch by 10-inch).  Grease
and flour lined pan.  Pour mixed ingredients evenly onto
prepared cookie sheet. Bake for about 15 to 18 minutes
or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean.

Now here's the secret.  On a flat surface, lay out a clean
cloth approximately the size of the cookie sheet.  Sift
powdered sugar over the cloth.  While the cake is still
warm, turn cake out onto prepared cloth.  Remove waxed
paper.  Trim the edges of the cake off.

Now roll the cake with the cloth, starting with the long side.
Roll as tightly as possible, then place on a cooling rack,
seam-side down.

When cool, unroll cake, remove cloth.  Spread soft ice
cream over entire cake to within one-half inch of the edges.
Re-roll cake and place seam-side down in the freezer for at
least 3-hours.  Cut and serve.

Varieties:  (1) add chocolate chips to the soft ice cream;
(2) Use frozen yogurt instead of ice cream; (3) use Cool
Whip instead of ice cream - freeze it; tastes a lot like ice
cream and is lower calories; (4) add your favorite jelly or
preserves for a great Jelly Cake Roll and (5) use your
imagination.

Most of all - have fun with the project.  The kids will love your
efforts and it's a great treat for guests anytime.

Happy  Day!

KITCHEN TIP OF THE WEEK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Melting Chocolate
If you've had your oven on for another use, you can take
advantage of the lingering heat to melt chocolate. Place
the chocolate in a small oven-proof bowl; set the bowl in
the "warm" oven. When the chocolate is almost melted,
remove the bowl and stir the chocolate till it is melted
and smooth.

1 cup sugar

Filling:
2 cups powdered sugar
one-half cup margarine
1-Tablespoon water
one-half teaspoon mint extract
3 drops green food coloring

Topping:
1 pkg. (10-oz) mint chocolate chips
9-Tablespoons margarine
