DirectRecipes(tm) Weekly

Dear Subscriber,

Let's talk pots and pans, kitchen appliances and tools.

Every good cook knows having and using the proper kitchenware 
is as important as the ingredients used in the recipe.     

From cast iron to copper, non-stick to stainless steel, the 
options in cookware today are varied.   What you choose has 
everything to do with personal preference -- the foods you 
enjoy cooking and the cookware you`re most comfortable using.

Making muffins -- you'll need a muffin tin.  Your recipe calls 
for a springform pan, where do you find it?  We found a place 
online called Chef's.  Chefscatalog.com offers a grand array of 
professional quality products for your cooking needs.  They 
carry world-class name brands such as: Calphalon, Cuisinart, 
Henckels, KitchenAid, Krups, Le Creuset and more.

Looking for a wedding gift?  It is said:  "the way to a man's 
heart is through his stomach."  If this is true, the way for the 
bride to get there is with proper kitchen tools.  A food 
processor, coffee maker or maybe a waffle iron are items that 
could be useful for the wedding couple.  

Now is the time of year to take the cooking outdoors.  Where 
there's a grill, there's a way to make a terrific meal.  Chef's 
has cut the price on the popular Salton George Foreman compact 
electric grill and also the vast Salton George Foreman Gas Grill 
(this is the gabooza -- the big one)!  The one-stop cookery site
has the long handled tongs, spatula or brush; all needs, just a 
click away.   
Let's go shopping!

SAUCE
2 cups brown sugar
1-1/2 cups water
2 Tablespoons (1/4 stick) butter
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

BATTER
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup granulated sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup milk
2 Tablespoons melted butter
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup very coarsely chopped pecans

Preheat oven to 350F. Prepare sauce first. 
In a medium saucepan, combine the first 4 ingredients. Bring to a boil
over medium heat and cook, uncovered, for 5 minutes. Remove from heat,
stir in the vanilla, and set aside while you prepare the batter.

In a mixer bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon and
salt. Combine the milk, melted butter, and vanilla in a small bowl and
add it all at once to the flour mixture; blend quickly. Spread in an
oiled 9 x 13-inch cake pan, and pour the reserved sauce over the top. Do
not mix in. Scatter the pecans over the liquid. 

Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until the center bubbles up. Serve warm
with cream or ice cream.

PERSONAL NOTE: In my experience, a 9 X 13 cake pan is too big. The cake
comes out very flat. I use an 8 X 8 pan instead. If you opt for the
smaller pan, be sure to put a cookie sheet or foil under the pan,
because it may just bubble over on you (and it leaves a horrible, sticky
mess to clean up if you don't).
