Dear Subscriber,

Steak is the ultimate form of meat.  If you like meat,
you love a good steak!

For Labor Day, steak-lovers will be firing up the grill.
The flavor and aroma of any steak comes alive when
grilled, starting with the king of all cuts, the filet mignon.
It wears the proud crown as it's the mildest and most
tender of all steaks.

This is not to say that a lean top sirloin steak or
the mighty porterhouse steak or the classic t-bone
steak is not succulent, flavorful, and tender. Each
of these are excellent selections for broiling, pan searing, or
grilling.

You may want to prepare your steak with a favorite
marinade or rub.  Either way, remove the steak
from refrigeration about an hour before cooking.
Start with a cold grid. If it is hot, oil the grid to
prevent sticking.

Steak is enjoyed differently by all.  To some, steak
sauce is a must, while others like it hot with salsa.
But the true connoisseur of steak adds only a dash of salt, 
pepper, maybe some garlic. and only serves the very best...
premium quality Omaha Steaks. 

The grill, an Omaha Steak and Labor Day go together.  Can
you smell the delicious aroma in the air?

Happy Day!<br>

KITCHEN TIP OF THE WEEK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Whenever grilling, use tongs to turn the meat.
A fork should never be used as it will punch holes
in the meat and allow the natural juices to escape,
causing the meat to lose flavor and become chewy.
