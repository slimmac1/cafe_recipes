Dear Recipe Fan Chris,

As temperatures rise, appetites diminish, along 
with the will to cook. Hot weather brings on a 
challenge to a homemaker's wit and wisdom.  
Minimum effort in the kitchen becomes the need.

Salads top the list of warm weather appetite 
tempters. Served as a main dish, or as a crisp 
accompaniment, salads supply a cool, inviting 
touch even on the warmest days.  

Start with a selection of greens.  Include iceberg 
lettuce, add a mixture of maybe escarole, endive, 
watercress or romaine lettuce or even spinach 
greens to make both a colorful and nutritious 
blend of greens.  

Greens should not only look fresh and appealing, 
but should crackle when you eat them.  One way to 
accomplish this is to rinse your lettuce leaves under 
very cold water, shake off excess moisture, then pat 
dry.  Lay them in a bowl (preferably stainless steel 
bowl) and cover the bowl with a damp cotton cloth.   
Refrigerate for a couple hours before preparing the 
remaining salad.  Just before serving, tear cold, 
crisp lettuce leaves into a pretty serving bowl. 

The more color added to a salad, the more appealing 
it becomes.  Some ideas for your summertime 
vegetable salad are any combination of tomatoes, 
cucumbers, black olives, sliced raw summer squash, 
radishes, green, red or yellow bell pepper, broccoli, 
cauliflower, green beans, pea pods, carrot curls, 
cheese, hard boiled eggs, mushrooms, and red onion 
slices.  If you like crunches, sprinkle your salad with 
Chinese noodles or croutons. 

Just before serving, toss the salad with just the right 
amount of your favorite dressing. Don't be stingy with 
the dressing to allow leaves left undressed. Yet on the 
other hand, don't be so lavish that you drown the lettuce.  

If you're having company and really want to impress your 
guests, here's a quick trick to make your lettuce look 
unique.  Sprinkle paprika on a paper towel. Roll the cut 
side of a damp head of lettuce in the paprika. It will make 
the most decorative red-laced lettuce for a pretty salad.  


Happy  Day!

KITCHEN TIP OF THE WEEK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When separating lettuce leaves, pick up the whole head
of lettuce and sharply hit the stem end against a cutting 
board or the edge of your sink. The entire core of the 
lettuce will lift right out with just a twist of the wrist. Now 
run cold water in the hole and all the leaves will separate 
beautifully.
