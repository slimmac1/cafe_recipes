Chicken -n- Dumplings

1 can Condensed Cream of Chicken soup
1 can Chicken Broth
1 can Sweet Peas, optional
12 oz boneless Chicken breast
1/4 cup chopped Onion (or Celery)
1 cup of 2% Milk
2 Tbs Butter or Margarine
6 frozen or canned biscuits

First, boil the chicken. Drain when done, then chop it up into bite-sized chunks.

Next, divide each biscuit into 8 smaller pieces. These will be your Dumplings. 

Finally, combine all of the ingredients in a 3 quart pot with lid. Heat to a boil, simmer on medium heat for 20-25 minutes. Stir frequently.

Season to taste. I used Ginger, Salt, Pepper and Onion Powder.

6 servings

Enjoy!
