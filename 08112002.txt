DirectRecipes(tm) Weekly


Dear Recipe Fan Chris,

Let's talk TOFU.   Yeah, that's the stuff you see 
in every grocery store and most of us pass it right 
up thinking, "I know I won't like that," -or- "I wouldn't 
know how to cook with that."  C'mon - I dare you -- 
keep reading and just maybe, you will venture into 
something new, delicious, and nutritious for dinner 
this week.  

As cheese is to milk - so tofu is to the soybean.   
As a cow gives milk, so does a soybean give soy 
milk.   As animal milk is separated into curds and 
whey in the production of cheese -- soy milk is 
separated into curds and whey to form tofu.

TOFU can be used in place of cheese.  

TOFU is versatile; let's compare the analogy of a 
potato.   A potato can be baked, boiled, broiled, 
grilled or fried.  It can be eaten whole, mashed, in 
cubes, mixed with a b'zillion other things to form an 
unlimited number of dishes.  TOFU is exactly the 
same.  

The taste of a boiled potato with no butter or salt is 
a little bland.  Raw tofu actually tastes much better 
than a plain boiled potato.  If you like yogurt or 
cottage cheese, then your taste buds will enjoy raw 
tofu. 

TOFU has digestible complete protein.  TOFU also 
has all eight essential amino acids.  

Do you do stir-fry?  Ever eaten in a Chinese 
restaurant?  Remember those white cubes of 
chicken in your delicious entree?  Yeah; you 
guessed it - good chance they were really tofu.  

TOFU can be used in place of chicken, such as in 
stir-fry recipes.

TOFU is like a dairy product in that it must be 
refrigerated and has a short shelf life. It is normally 
sold in plastic tubs, immersed in water.  The water 
should be poured off, the tofu rinsed and patted dry 
before using.

Another form of tofu is known as Silken Tofu, which 
often comes inside foil packages from Japan. The 
Silken Tofu is ultra-pasteurized and has a very long 
shelf life.  Silken Tofu is best used in soups.  Firm 
Tofu is much more versatile than Silken Tofu.

Lasagna sound good for dinner this week?  See 
our Recipe of the Week from Subscriber Ada Miller, 
who gives us Vegetable Lasagna with an option of 
using TOFU as a substitute for Mozzarella Cheese.  
Do you dare try something new?  

Happy  Day!

RECIPE OF THE WEEK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Vegetable Lasagna (Using Tofu)  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Using the TOFU is really great. You don't really 
taste it at all. This recipe is good for those who 
have diabetes. 
Submitted by....Subscriber:  Ada Miller
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
3-4 cups spaghetti sauce
12 whole wheat lasagna noodles
1/2 pound spinach, washed & chopped, or canned
1 cup cottage cheese
1 egg
3/4 cup Monterey Jack cheese, grated
3 Tablespoons chopped fresh parsley (optional)
1 teaspoon vegetable seasoning
3/4 cup Parmesan cheese, grated

1-3/4 cups Mozzarella, grated 
(OR)
2 cups TOFU, FIRM, cut into tiny chunks

Prepare sauce (I use the can or jar of spaghetti 
sauce; it's quicker). Meanwhile, cook noodles in 
water (with 1 teaspoon of oil added) for about 
10 minutes or until tender. Drain well. In a bowl 
combine all the ingredients except the spaghetti 
sauce. 

To assemble, spoon 3 to 4 Tablespoons of the 
sauce into the bottom of a 9"x13" baking pan (or 
comparable size).  Cover the sauce with 4 to 5 of 
the noodles, then a layer of the cheese mix, 
then the sauce. 

Make a second layer of the above, until all you have 
left is 4 to 5 noodles and sauce left. You should have 
two or three layers.

Bake in a 350 degree oven for 40 minutes. Let 
stand for 15 minutes before cutting into squares.
Makes 8-10 servings.
