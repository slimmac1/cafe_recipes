Dear slimmac1,

What do you get if you cross poison ivy with 
a four-leaf clover? A rash of good luck! 

Think 'green' and gather up all that good luck 
and toss it together with some delicious Irish 
recipes for a Happy St. Patrick's Day feast!   
You say you're not Irish?   No matter -- anyone 
can pin on a shamrock and enjoy the blessings of 
great Irish cooking.  

To the Irish, a day without potatoes is a day without 
nourishment.  There are probably 400 ways to prepare 
potatoes, including plain boiled-in-the-jacket Irish 
pototoes.  Try grating that Irish potato and making 
Irish "Potato Pancakes with Rum Applesauce" 
(Recipe of the Week - below).  

Corned Beef is the traditional offering for St. Patrick's 
Day.  Corned beef brisket, which is cured in a pickling 
sauce is the choicest cut.  It is flavorful, tender and 
slices well for sandwiches.  Cooking this delectable is 
so easy - cover brisket with water, and simmer one hour 
per pound or until a fork can penetrate to the center.  
Cut cabbage into 3-inch wedges and add to pot; simmer 
another 20 minutes. Always slice corned beef against the 
grain.  Slices well for sandwiches the next day also.  

"Cead mile failte" (100,000 welcomes) -- this is the 
flavoring offered with every dish in Ireland.

Happy St. Patrick's Day!

Keep your roll of plastic wrap in the 
freezer. It is easier to unroll, doesn't 
stick to itself until it warms up. It is 
also easier to tear.

While these are not low-fat, they are tasty and 
worth every calorie!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  
2 cups coarsely grated potatoes
3 eggs
2 Tablespoons flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 Tablespoon Irish whiskey
4 Tablespoons minced onion
Oil for frying

Place potatoes in strainer and press to remove excess 
liquid.  Transfer to mixing bowl.  Beat eggs slightly 
and stir into potatoes.  Mix flour and salt together 
and add to potato mixture.  Mix well and stir in minced 
onion and Irish whiskey.

Shape into 3-inch patties.  Heat skillet, grease and 
saute patties until bubbles appear on surface, turn over 
and brown flip-side.  Serve hot with Rum Applesauce and 
sour cream.  

Rum Applesauce
~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
6 Golden Delicious apples, peeled, cored and quartered
1 cup water
one-half cup packed dark brown sugar
1 teaspoon allspice
1 teaspoon ginger
2-ounces dark rum 

Place apples and water in saucepan and bring to boil; 
reduce heat and simmer 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.  
Add sugar, allspice, ginger and rum.  Bring to boil and 
simmer additional 20 minutes, stirring frequently.  

For quick applesauce topping, use canned applesauce and 
add flavor of your choice.  1 cup crushed pineapple, or 
1 cup raspberries.  These are good with grated orange 
rind sprinkled on top.    Another idea is using cold 
applesauce with 1-teaspoon vanilla or a few drops of almond
extract.  Cinnamon applesauce is good too.
