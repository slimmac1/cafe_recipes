Dear Recipe Fan Chris,

Let's talk Angel Food Cake - the wonderful, 
light and delicious no-fat dessert.  

An angel food cake is a simply a white, tall 
sponge cake.  This means it is made without 
egg yolks or any other source of fat.  Years 
ago making this heavenly delight required a 
deep bowl, a whisk and a very strong arm for 
whipping the egg whites.  Today the electric 
mixer has simplified the task.  I find it almost 
as economical and definitely quicker and 
easier to visit your local grocer and buy a 
ready-made angel food cake.  

Making angel food cake special is all in the 
filling, topping or in some cases, a frosting.  
The cake is very light, thus you need to choose 
a very light, even runny frosting or use no frosting 
at all.  If you like a sweet taste added, here's a 
quick and easy berry icing:  2 cups powdered 
sugar, 1/4 cup fresh berries (any kind, crushed), 
and about 2 to 3 teaspoons lemon juice.  
Gradually add just enough lemon juice until the 
icing is thin enough to manipulate onto the cake, 
without pushing it down. 

Puddings adapts well to angel food cake and 
are quick and easy.  Slice cake in three layers; 
spread your favorite chocolate or lemon pudding 
between the layers.  Refrigerate.  

Angel food cake can be torn in pieces and make 
into delectable desserts.  This week's Recipe of 
the Week is my own creation, which was published 
in Taste of Home magazine.  It is a favorite of my 
family; hope you enjoy this completely fat-free 
dessert.

Happy  Day!
