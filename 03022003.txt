Dear Recipe Fan Chris,

Want something easy for dinner tonight?  Casseroles can 
be tossed together in no time at all; most times they are a 
full meal.  Maybe add a salad, maybe some garlic bread 
or dinner rolls and it's dinner! 

My husband knows I love what is called Parkerhouse 
Dinner Rolls, and yesterday he came across a sale at the 
bakery, so came home with 2 dozen of them.  Well, tacos 
were on the original menu last night, but the agenda was 
quickly changed to something with Parkerhouse Dinner 
Rolls.

The answer was a casserole.  I opened 2 cans of tuna, 
2 cans of Cream of Mushroom soup, 1 can of stewed 
tomatoes, cooked up some noodles, added a handful of 
frozen peas and dinner was in the oven.  Heat thoroughly 
in a 350-oven; and it's dinner with rolls and butter (honey 
on the rolls, if you like that).  

Casseroles are nothing but a combination of foods that 
blend well together.  Here's one I made up one night and 
now we make it about once a month.  I call it "Toasty 
Casserole".  Take 4 slices of bread, toast them, then 
butter both sides.  Lay in casserole dish or an oblong 
oven pan.  Brown 1-lb. hamburger, then sprinkle over the 
top of toast.  Then spread with grated Cheddar cheese. 
How much you use depends on how much you like cheese.  
Beat two eggs together, add about 2-Tablespoons of milk.  
Pour over top.  Heat for 30 to 40 minutes in a 350-degree 
oven.  It's delicious with fresh broccoli as a side dish.  

From Last Week's Issue:  
In last week's "Impossibly Easy Lasagna Pie" subscriber 
submitted recipe, it seems the recipe went to print without 
me noticing the "amount" of the Ricotta Cheese for the 
recipe was not there.  I want to thank everyone who has 
written me about this and I apologize for not noticing that 
myself.  

To doubly bumble this error, I replied to several of you who 
so courteously wrote me, saying I would think about 2 cups 
would be right.  Wrong Again!  I wrote to our subscriber who 
submitted the recipe, but have received no reply.  So I went 
recipe hunting, and found the recipe, which calls for 1/3 cup 
Ricotta Cheese.  EEEKKKK... did anyone try it with 2 cups?  
Here are the ingredients for "Impossibly Easy Lasagna Pie". 

1/3 cup Ricotta Cheese or small curd creamed cottage cheese 
3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese 
1 pound ground beef 
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese (4 ounces) 
1/2 cup spaghetti sauce 
1/2 teaspoon salt 
1/2 cup Original Bisquick® 
1 cup milk 
2 eggs 


Happy Day!
