Dear Recipe Fan Chris,

A wok is probably the oldest cooking utensil used 
in today's modern kitchen. The bowl-shaped pan 
was developed by the ancient Chinese. A good wok 
is made of very heavy-gauge rolled carbon steel, 
which conducts heat well. Ideal for wok cookery is a 
gas stove. However, you will find electric woks in 
today's market.

Today's most popular use of a wok is stir frying. One 
thing to remember is not to heat the oil in the wok 
before adding ingredients. This will cause your food 
to stick to the wok. The term used by professional 
Chinese cooks is "hot wok -- cold oil".

When meat and vegetables are to be combined, cook 
the meat first, until near done. Take it out of the wok, 
set it aside and keep it warm. Clean the wok with a 
paper towel, reheat to a very high temperature and 
again add oil, then immediately the first vegetables to 
be cooked. The first veggies usually are carrots, 
potatoes or any that require longer cooking time. 

Food in your wok should be continuously stirred and 
turned. Add other veggies. When near done, return meat 
to the wok. Next add seasonings or sauce, which are 
always added last to avoid food from becoming soggy.  
Wok cooking is fast and easy. The most difficult part is 
cutting up the ingredients. Have all ingredients ready to 
add nearby the wok. 

Enjoy using your wok and eat healthy.

Happy  Day!
