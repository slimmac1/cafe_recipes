Dear Recipe Fan Chris,

When you want an easy meal in one dish, think 
casserole.  

Casseroles are quick and easy to prepare, and most 
freeze well.  For working Moms, it's easy to prepare a 
large casserole on the weekend, then freeze in individual 
portions for quick on-the-go meals for your busy family 
members.  

Casseroles taste good and adhere to easy preparation.  
Matter of fact, no two casseroles need be exactly the same.  
Add what you like, add what you have handy.  Take some 
ground beef, or leftover chicken, add noodles or potatoes, 
some cut up veggies, add a can of soup - presto - it equals 
casserole!  

A favorite casserole around our home is what I've given the 
name "Chicky Casserole".  When I make chicken, I always 
make extra so there is some leftover for this casserole.  
Cut up about 4 or 5 pieces of chicken into one-inch cubes.  
Steam about 3-cups brussel sprouts until tender crisp.  Also 
steam about two cups of baby carrots until tender crisp.  
(Sliced or chunks of big carrots work just as well.)   Next 
cook up about 1/2 pound of flat egg noodles.  

Take 2 cans of cream of chicken soup, 1 can of water.  To 
give the casserole it's very special flavor, add about 1/2 
bunch of fresh parsley and 3-Tablespoons of Dijon mustard.  
Combine everything in a big casserole dish and bake at 
350-degrees for 40 minutes.  

Note:  Sometimes I put everything into my slow cooker set 
on medium temperature and 2 hours later, it's dinner!  What 
is nice about the slow cooker is turn down to low, and it's just 
as ready 3 hours, 4 hours later or whenever each member of 
the household arrives for dinner.  

If you try my "Chicky Casserole" - let me know how you like it - 
and send me your favorite casserole recipe to share with 
everyone!

KITCHEN TIP OF THE WEEK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Buy ground beef in family packs or ask the butcher to 
grind roasts you purchase at a sale price.  At home, 
divide into individual size packages in zip-lock type 
bags.  To save space in the freezer and get less 
freezer burn on your meat, use a rolling pin to evenly 
make flat packages.  When it comes time to thaw, it 
will thaw quicker this way also.

Cheesy Chicken Noodle Casserole  

Here is a casserole recipe I came up with in college... 
it's very filling, but delicious and easy to make!  
Submitted by.... Lauren Macey, Subscriber 
~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
1 can Cream of Chicken soup 
2/3 can milk (use empty can from soup)
1 package TownHouse crackers 
6 oz. Elbow Macaroni (approximately) 
1/2 teaspoon pepper 
1/2 teaspoon Lawry's seasoned salt (optional) 
1/2 teaspoon Mrs Dash or other seasoning blend 
3 oz. Monterey Jack cheese (optional) 
small amount of butter or margarine OR Pam 
cooking spray 

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Lightly grease an 
8 inch square casserole dish with butter, margarine, 
or cooking spray. Spread a layer of TownHouse 
crackers across the bottom, and also around the 
sides. 

Fully cook macaroni in a separate pot, drain, and 
then add half of the prepared macaroni over the 
crackers. Spread 1/2 of the can of Cream of Chicken 
soup over the macaroni, making sure to cover all 
areas, then add 1/3 of the can of milk, pouring it over 
all areas. Sprinkle the pepper and seasoned salt over 
all areas of the casserole, and then place the remaining 
noodles in the dish as a second layer. Spread the 
remaining soup over noodles, add the rest of the milk, 
and then sprinkle the seasoning blend over the top. 
Crumble the remaining crackers and sprinkle over 
the top. 

Bake for 35 minutes. Remove the casserole and cover 
the top with Monterey Jack cheese, using either 
pre-shredded cheese or small slices (2" by 1" at the 
largest). Return casserole to oven for 10 minutes or until 
cheese is melted. Serves 2-4 (depending on whether 
it is a main or side dish.)
