Dear slimmac1,

We have something exciting and different this week for 
our many subscribers who have written about wanting 
low-fat recipes.

There are more choices in your meats today.  Specialty meats 
are all natural and higher in protein and lower in fat.  Have 
you ever thought about buffalo meat?

The popularity of Buffalo meat and it's health benefits are 
growing each year.  There are buffalo steaks, roasts, burgers, 
ground buffalo and even hot polish and bratwurst made with 
buffalo.  And you owe it to yourself to try buffalo hot dogs, 
known as "buffdogs".
