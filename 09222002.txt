Dear Recipe Fan Chris,

The kids are back in school.  Here's some ideas to tuck 
into school lunch boxes or treats for after-school snacks 
that are fun to make, save money and are healthy, tasty 
and creative for the kids.

We all know to have fruit on hand for the kids or even a 
cut up veggie platter.  Maybe make a dip for the veggies 
of cottage cheese and Ranch salad dressing whirred 
together in the blender.  Another tasty dip is plain yogurt 
and peanut butter blended together.  (Ratio:  3/4 yogurt to 
1/4 peanut butter.)  But this gets old and the kids want 
something new and different.  

How about a Peanut Butter Burrito?  Easy to fix and 
healthy too!  Take a large-size soft tortilla, spread peanut 
butter over one side.  Peel and insert a banana.  Sprinkle 
with cinnamon and roll up.  These are really good!  Adults 
like them, too.

Another favorite is mini-pizzas.  These are really so easy 
and you can be so creative with ingredients.  Start with a 
tube of refrigerator biscuits.  Just flatten each biscuit to form 
mini pizza crust.  Then spread a teaspoon or two of canned 
pizza sauce, or even spaghetti sauce or tomato sauce over 
biscuit.  Add a layer of cheese of your choice. Top with thin 
slices of hot dogs or smokey links. There's an endless list of 
things you can top your mini-pizza with.  The items you buy for 
toppings really go a long way because it only takes a little for 
each biscuit. Make these up ahead of time.  When the kids 
come home from school, just pop into the microwave for a few 
seconds and it's ready when the kids say, "Mom - what's 
to eat?"  

Sometimes the way you present normal snacks to kids makes 
them special.  One idea is to take a cupcake tin and insert in 
each spot a different treat.  When they come home, they can 
pick and choose what they like.  Some ideas is tiny chunks of 
cheese, grapes in another, one with raisins, or pretzels, 
cereals, strawberries, crackers...the list is endless.  

Mini-kabobs are cool treats too.  Use toothpicks as your 
skewers.  Thread pineapple pieces, small chunks of cheese, 
green pepper, strawberries, grape tomatoes, fresh broccoli, 
hot dogs...again the list is endless.  Make these up ahead of 
time and have handy in the refrigerator. 

The Recipe of the Week is one of the greatest ideas for lunch 
boxes and treats and it's so easy.  Be sure to try these 
Homemade Fruit Jerkys.  They go a long way, kids simply love 
them and they are so healthy.  

Happy  Day!

KITCHEN TIP OF THE WEEK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Don't add salt to the water when cooking frozen or canned 
corn. If salt is desired, you can salt it after it is cooked. Instead, 
add sugar. A teaspoon of sugar added to your corn niblets will 
bring out the sweet taste of sweet corn.

RECIPE OF THE WEEK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Homemade Fruit Jerky  
~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
Preparation:  
*Remove stones or pits.  Seeds of berries or grapes do 
not need to be removed.
*Peel or don't peel; depending upon individual preference.
*Cut different fruits into chunks and puree in blender 
or processor.
*For yellow or light colored fruit, add 1-Tablespoon of 
lemon or lime juice for each quart of fruit.
* Personal preference: Add 1-Tablespoon of honey per 
quart if you feel sweetening is needed.
*Line cookie sheet(s) with waxed paper.
*Pour the puree onto the sheet about 1/4 inch deep.  
Distribute evenly by tilting the sheet; do not use a spatula 
or knife. When the cookie sheet is completely covered, 
the right amount of puree has been applied.

Oven Drying: 
Set oven at lowest setting (140 degrees F). Place the 
sheet in the oven and leave the oven door cracked open 
two to six inches. The fruit jerky will be dried in four to 
five hours.

Storage:  
After loosening the edge and peeling it back about an inch, 
roll the waxed paper and the dried leather in one piece into 
a loose roll. The dried fruit roll can be stored for years in the 
freezer, for months in the refrigerator and many weeks at 
room temperature (70 degrees or less).

Note:  
Properly dried fruit leather will be sticky to the touch but 
will peel easily from the waxed paper.
