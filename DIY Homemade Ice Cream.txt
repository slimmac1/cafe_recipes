DIY Homemade Ice Cream

What you’ll need:

- 2 TBLSP sugar
- 1 Cup half & half (or light cream)
- 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/2 cup salt 
- ice
- gallon-sized Ziploc bag
- sandwich size Ziploc bag

Directions:

1) Mix the sugar, half & half and vanilla together. Pour into a sandwich baggy. Squeeze out as much air as possible and seal tightly.

2) Now fill the gallon Ziploc bag halfway with ice and pour the salt over the ice; add the bag of half and half.

3) Make sure it’s sealed tightly and start shaking.
Shake, Shake, Shake for 5 minutes. (Your hands will get COLDDDDD use gloves or a dish towel)

4) It should only take 5-6 minutes of shaking. Open the gallon sized bag and check to see if the ice cream is finished.
Once finished, rinse the salt off the sandwich bag.

5) Scoop into a bowl OR pop a spoon straight into the bag.
