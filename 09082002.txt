Dear Recipe Fan Chris,

Get out the refried beans, ground beef, hot spices, 
some healthy fruits and vegiges such as fresh 
tomatoes, lettuce, spinach, hot peppers, or 
avocados for a tantalizing change of pace.

Foods with a spicy, hot, fiery twist such as tacos, 
enchiladas, tortillas, frijoles and guacamole are 
becoming ever more popular during the past decade. 
Americans have adopted the spicy tastes and 
grocers now carry a complete line of chiles, peppers, 
and salsas (sauces).

Most of these foods go hand-in-hand with the tortilla. 
The original tortilla is a flat pancake made of masa, 
an unleavened corn flour. Today you will find several 
varieties and sizes of tortillas at your local grocery store. 

The tortilla is used as a plate, spoon, snack or sandwich. 
Tortillas even come in mini-form snacks called chips. 
They are used as appetizers or snacks and are dipped 
in guacamole, cheese, bean dips or hot sauces. 

Guacamole is easy to whip together. Take 2 ripe 
avocados, peeled and chopped and 2 ripe tomatoes, 
peeled and chopped. Add 1 chopped onion, salt to taste 
and 2 TB. parsley. Now comes the good part - finely 
mince 2 hot chilies (purchased in a can or jar). Mash 
everything together or put everything in your food chopper 
or blender. Serve immediately as a dip for chips, or on 
tacos or tostados.  


Happy  Day!

KITCHEN TIP OF THE WEEK

Corn-on-Cob Tips from our Subscribers:  

~Submitted by: Norma Rekar of Klamath Falls, OR  
When you buy corn in the husk do not open it. Just take 
for granted it is OK. Then when you get it home put it, husks 
and all into the microwave on high for 4 minutes for one ear 
or 8 minutes for 2 ears. When done take out with hot pads 
and holding with something, peel it. The husks, silk and 
everything falls right off. It will be the best corn you have 
ever had. In fact when I served it to my sister she bought 
a microwave.  

~Submitted by: Jerry Perlstein of Medford, NY  
When boiling corn on the cob, add one cup of milk to 
your water. It makes the cob softer and the corn sweeter.

RECIPE OF THE WEEK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*Beefy-Chili Burritos with Cheese*
~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
Add tossed salad with low-fat dressing for a delicious 
and low-fat meal! 
Submitted by....Theresa Ball of Senoia, GA  
---------------------------- 
1 package of fat-free flour tortilla shells 
16 oz. fat-free shredded cheddar cheese 
1 lb ground round 
2 cans of fat-free chili 

In medium pan brown beef. Add both cans of chili and 
6 oz. of cheddar cheese. Stir over medium-low heat 
until cheese is completely melted. 

Put one-half of the beefy-chili mixture in the middle of 
the soft taco. Roll up. Sprinkle 1 oz of cheddar cheese 
on top. Microwave about 10 seconds to melt cheese. 
Serve warm. 

Garnish with salsa, if desired. 
I like to substitute low-fat cheese instead of fat-free 
because it melts easier, but it does add a few more 
calories.

10 servings; calories per serving: 260 - Fat: 4.6 grams
