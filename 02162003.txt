Dear Recipe Fan Chris,

WOW!  Thanks to everyone. You really came through 
with the Impossible Pie recipes!  Will put a couple in 
today and a few next week.  Thank you so much! I love 
sharing recipes from our DirectRecipes(tm) subscribers.  

Also, I heard from someone in Australia who does not 
have access to Bisquick Mix.  This subscriber wanted 
to know the ingredients to make the mix or find a 
comparable product.  I found a recipe on how to make 
your own Bisquick Mix and would like to share it with 
everyone if we have any others who would like to 
replace Bisquick.  

Enjoy making your Impossible Pies! 

Happy Day!
~ Barb ~

Make Your Own Bisquick Mix

8 1/2 cups flour 
1 Tablespoon baking powder 
1 Tablespoon salt 
2 teaspoons cream of tartar 
1 teaspoon baking soda 
1 1/2 cup instant nonfat dry-milk 
2 1/4 cups vegetable shortening 

Sift together all dry ingredients into a large bowl. Blend
well. With pastry blender, cut in shortening. Mixture should
resemble corn meal in texture. 

Put in large airtight container. Label. Date clearly - 
should be used in 10 to 12 weeks. 

Store in cool, dry place. Makes about 13 cups of quick 
mix. Can be used in any recipe that calls for Bisquick.

KITCHEN TIP OF THE WEEK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Submitted by... Beth Palecek from New Jersey

When a recipe calls for frozen chopped spinach, 
thawed and drained...
I remove outer paper and open corners of box.  Then 
place on paper plate and defrost in microwave.  When 
thawed, you just squeeze box to drain liquid and it is 
ready.  This saves a lot of time and you can make a 
great meal at the last minute ...

Thank you, Beth.  That's a great tip!

Impossible Bar-be-que Pie   

Aren't Impossible Pies fun to make? Some of the best 
ones are where you just throw in left-overs and be creative. 
That's what I did with the following. Give them a try and
