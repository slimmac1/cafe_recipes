Dear slimmac1,

Get ready, get set...because the kick-off of the 35th 
Annual Super Bowl is about to take place.  You'll want 
to have plenty of edible goodies ready and waiting by 
game time.

First you'll have to find the proper place to set up a 
snack table near your armchair quarterback, yet out of 
the running field between the chair and the TV set.

Next you'll need a selection of finger foods.  A simple 
treat is to slice mozzarella cheese onto a favorite cracker 
such as wheat thins.  You'll want to pop this in the 
microwave for a few seconds to just gently start to melt 
the cheese.  This allows the cheese to stay on the cracker 
when your football fan's eyes are on the game and their hands 
are on the snack.

Another Super Bowl blind edible is Field Goal Cracker Jack.  
Mix 7 cups of popped corn with 1 cup shelled peanuts.  Heat 
one-half cup honey with one-fourth cup butter until blended; 
then cool it slightly.  Pour over popcorn, stirring as you 
pour.  Pop in a 350-degree oven for about 5-minutes or until 
crisp.  Watch carefully so it doesn't burn.  Cool and serve.

We have several touchdown snack ideas from our subscribers 
in Recipes of the Week (below). These will guarantee you a 
winner no matter what the final outcome of Super Bowl XXXV.

Happy Day!
~Barb~
