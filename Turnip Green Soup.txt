Dear slimmac1,

Soup's On!

Call it potage, call it chowder, or call it consomme.  
However dubbed, a hearty, well-blended hot bowl of soup 
hits the spot on cold wintry days. Piping hot soups and 
stews, thick and rich with seasonings, leave us with
a belly-warming, satisfied feeling.

One of the best foods to come out of Italy is Italian 
minestrone.  By its very nature, minestrone is a peasant 
soup, basically a mixture of beans and fresh vegetables 
simmered in bean broth and rich beef stock or water
with meats, herbs, olive oil, pasta and freshly grated 
cheese.  Like most great peasant dishes, it is fit for 
the most sophisticated palate.

Also warming this time of year are the cream soups or 
chowders.  For the richest of cream soups, bind with egg 
yolks.  All cream soups, whether bound with egg or not, are 
ruined by boiling.  Be sure to heat just to the boiling 
point or cook your cream soup in the top of a double boiler 
over boiling water.  It is best to reheat the same way.

When serving cream soups, take advantage of garnishes adaptable 
to the soups they adorn.  Some suggestions are french-fried 
onions, grated cheeses, pretzel twists, popcorn, toasted 
nuts, chopped avocado, sliced carrots, cucumber, zucchini 
or radishes.

Sister to soup is stew.  The basic difference is whether 
the utensil used is a spoon or fork.  As in soup, be sure 
to cook more than enough because leftovers are tastier 
than the original entree.  Ingredients need be only
as costly as your budget allows because even the least 
tender meat cuts and firmest vegetables can be simmered 
to fork-tenderness with long, slow cooking.

The next morning you waken to nippy temperatures, get 
down the soup pot, put in meat and-or bones, add veggies, 
maybe some noodles, add a little love and ingenuity and 
put together a tummy-teaser that will surely demand seconds.

Happy Day!

          KITCHEN TIP OF THE WEEK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  
          Removing Fat From Soup   
       ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
* Drop a lettuce leaf into a pot of homemade 
soup to absorb excess grease from the top.
* If time allows, the best method of removing 
fat is refrigeration until the fat hardens. 
If you put a piece of waxed paper over the 
top of the soup, etc. it can be peeled right 
off, along with the hardened fat.
* Ice cubes will also eliminate the fat from 
soup and stew. Just drop a few into the pot and 
stir; the fat will cling to the cubes; discard 
the cubes before they melt. Or, wrap ice cubes 
in paper towel or cheesecloth and skim over the top.
