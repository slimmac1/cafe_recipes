Dear slimmac1,

We've had many requests for special and different recipes, 
healthy eating recipes and some  subscribers just ask for 
different ideas of what to cook each day.  Alas!  We are 
here to please.  Here's an idea to help in the humdrum of 
what to cook healthy and delicious tonight.

How does "Shrimp, Corn and Ham Chowder" sound?  That's a 
special recipe by Rosie O'Donnell.   Or maybe Olympia 
Dukakis' Greek Salad would hit the spot?   Serve tonight's 
entree with Patti LaBelle's "Aunt Hattie's Sweet Tater Bread".    
These recipes along with a dozen more are available to you free.

Fifteen celebrities have come together to fight against 
hunger by participating in the Canned Food Alliance Five 
Star Celebrity Cookbook.  For every celebrity who submitted
a recipe to the cookbook, the Canned Food Alliance made a 
donation in his or her name to Share Our Strength.

You too can help this worthy cause by enclosing your donation 
when ordering your copy of Canned Food Alliance Five Star 
Celebrity Cookbook.  Share Our Strength works toward ending 
hunger and poverty in the United States and around the world.
