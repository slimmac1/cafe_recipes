Dear Recipe Fan Chris,

Whether you're having a celebration at the office, a home 
holiday party or just spending New Year's Eve with the 
family, snacks or hors d'oerves probably are in demand.     

Coated pecans are yummy.  Whip together 1 egg white, 
slowly add 1 cup brown sugar and 1-Tablespoon flour, a 
dash of salt, 1-teaspoon vanilla.  Then fold in about 2-1/2 
cups pecan halves. Lay each coated pecan on a greased 
cookie sheet and bake at 275 degrees for about 40 
minutes.  Warning; you won't have left-overs.  

The star of most hors d'oeuvres trays is usually stuffed 
mushrooms.  Have printed copies of this recipe handy 
because everyone will be asking for the recipe.  (This 
recipe can be easily doubled.)  

Start with 2-1/2 dozen "large" mushrooms.  Pluck stems 
from mushroom tops, and cut stems in tiny pieces.  Fry 
1/2 lb. Jimmy Dean hot pork sausage, adding the cut 
stems to mixture. (You do not have to add stems, you 
can save all or half and use them in an omelet for 
breakfast.)  Drain grease from meat; cool.  About an 
hour later, mix the cooked sausage and stems with 1 
(4-oz) package of softened cream cheese. Add some 
green onion tops and mix well.  Stuff the mushroom tops 
with mixture. Bake on a cookie sheet at 325 degrees 
until light brown, about 20 to 25 minutes. Good hot or cold.  

Always a hit is guacamole dip.  At our home we enjoy this 
quick and easy dip with tortilla chips. Mash 2 avocados, 
add 1 (16-oz) container of cottage cheese and 1 (12-oz) 
bottle of your favorite salsa.  Mix well. 

Herbed cream cheese is one more quick and easy dip 
that will add some variety to the table. This versatile dip 
will let you use what's in your garden, or what's most easily 
available in the market. Add a bit of light cream, garlic or 
maybe some chopped jalepeno peppers, and it's ready 
for serving.   

You'll want to have an array of chips, crackers or breads 
for dipping.  Be sure to see the "Recipes of the Week"
(below) for Pita Crisps and Pepperoni Bread Sticks.  
Both will bring you compliments. 

For a fizzy non-alcoholic drink that is flavorful and a healthy 
alternative to sodas, take any flavor sparkling water and 
add your favorite juice.  A particular favorite at our home is 
the mixture of half and half - sparkling lemon and orange
juice.  For a pretty drink, start with sparkling raspberry and 
add grape juice.  

Happy New Year from the entire staff at

Happy  Day!
