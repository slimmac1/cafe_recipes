Dear Recipe Fan Chris,

Easter is just about a month away.  Since there are so 
many recipes to share for the holiday ahead, we are 
starting our Easter coverage this week.  If you have a 
recipe you'd like to share, please type it in an email (do 
not send an attachment) and send to 
Barb@DirectResponse.com

Let's start out with a familiar object for Easter, but usually 
store boughten; try making your own Cream-Filled 
Chocolate Easter Eggs.  It will be a sensation to family 
and guests.  Nah, it's not difficult and it's fun too!  Get the 
kids to help. They will be so proud!

Ingredients:
1 cup soft butter
2 teaspoons salt
4 teaspoons vanilla
1 can condensed milk (Eagle Brand)
10 cups powdered sugar
1 teaspoon yellow food coloring
1 lb. semi-sweet chocolate

Beat butter, salt and vanilla until fluffy. Add milk, beat in 
sugar. Blend until stiff. Dust with brown sugar. Knead 
until smooth.

Take about 1/3 of the mixture, and add yellow food coloring.  
Shape the yellow colored portion into approx. 20 balls.  
This will be the "yolk" of your egg.  Next divide the white 
portion into about 20 pieces of dough.  Form the white 
around the "yolk" to form an oval white egg.  Dry at room 
temperature on paper towels for 24 hours.

Melt chocolate in double boiler or in microwave until 
smooth. Dip eggs in chocolate. Note: about 1-lb. paraffin 
wax may be added and melted with chocolate to prevent 
chocolate from melting in your hands. (Paraffin is optional.) 
Once dipped, cool at room temperature. Refrigerate after 
cool.

When sliced or bit into, your Cream-Filled Chocolate 
Easter Eggs will have a white cream filling with a yellow 
filling that appears to be the yolk.  It's really cool.

Happy Day!
