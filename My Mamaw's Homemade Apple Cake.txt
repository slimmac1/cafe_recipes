DirectRecipes(tm) Weekly



Dear Subscriber,

The entire staff here at DirectRecipes(tm) Newsletter
thanks everyone for your gracious comments, 
suggestions and compliments.  This week I'd like
to acknowledge one of our most popular responses.

In November, we did a guest contributor newsletter
which many of our members enjoyed.  Several have 
written us for copies of that newsletter, plus we now
have many, many new members.  By popular demand, 
we are repeating Cathy Borden's guest contribution.

Happy Day!
~Barb~

*My Mamaw's Homemade Apple Cake*
Guest Contributor...Cathy Borden of Louisville, KY

When people think of my Mamaw, there are several 
things that come to mind. Her kindness is the first 
thing. When the "flood of '37" hit Louisville, her 
house was one of the few that was not submerged. 
So, in order for her to be part of her community, she 
prepared food for the National Guard, who were called 
in. The government would deliver crates of food, and 
she cooked from scratch. The guardsmen had their 
meals at her home, with my mom helping. Anything 
left was theirs to keep, and my mother said when 
things got back to normal, they had enough food to 
last for a year.

Another thing that comes to mind was her 
compassion. She never let anyone walk out of the 
house without saying "put your cap on, do you have 
your gloves? Cover your mouth with that scarf so you 
won't catch your death of cold." And the funniest, 
once when my sister was going out in a mini skirt, 
my mamaw said "you are going to catch cold in a 
place where you can't sneeze." That one still makes 
me laugh. She even used to serve the birds warm 
bread when it was chilly.

And of course, there was her apple cake. I could tell 
you how our mouth would water the day before 
Thanksgiving when she baked this, or how moist it 
was. How a spoon of whipped cream topped it off 
perfectly. But, bake it for yourself, and you can taste 
the reason why she was so popular.

KITCHEN TIP OF THE WEEK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Add a pinch of salt to your coffee grounds when making
coffee.  This will improve the coffee flavor as it helps to 
remove some of the acid taste.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1 cup cooking oil
2 cups sugar
3 eggs
2 cups self rising flour
1 teaspoon vanilla
3 cups chopped apples
1 cup nuts
1/2 cup raisins
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1 teaspoon nutmeg

Combine oil, sugar & eggs. Beat well. Add flour 
and beat well. Add remaining ingredients and 
blend well with spoon or spatula. Turn batter into 
a greased & floured 13 x 9 pan. Bake at 350 
degrees for 40 - 45 minutes. (Don't forget her 
trick about lightly flouring the apples, nuts and 
raisins so they distribute evenly throughout the 
cake.)

Enjoy! 
Cathy
