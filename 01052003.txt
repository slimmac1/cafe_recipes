Dear Recipe Fan Chris,

Living in Florida, I don't always realize when 
cold-weather foods need to be on the agenda.  But 
this last week, it dipped into the 40's in our warm 
weather state, and I was scrambling for the hot 
cocoa and warm, soothing oatmeal for breakfast.  

Dinner became a quick pot of hot chili because I did 
not have any chicken stock made or frozen for 
homemade chicken soup.  The next day I made a 
double batch of chicken stock, some for now and 
some to freeze for when the next cold spell hits.  

Chicken stock is very easy to make, it's just time 
consuming.  Once made, you can freeze portions for 
quick use in many different recipes.  

Take the whole chicken and rinse it well under cold 
water. Place in a large stock pot and cover chicken 
with cold water. (Usually about 18 cups of water.)  
Bring to a boil, turn down to simmer for about an hour. 
Remove the chicken from the water and set aside 
to cool.   

To the reserved water, add 2 stalks of celery, 2 carrots 
and one onion, all of which have been chopped into 
about 1-inch pieces.  Season with 1 teaspoon whole 
black peppercorns, 1 teaspoon thyme, and 
2-Tablespoons parsley.  Add 2-Tablespoons lemon 
juice.  

Once the chicken is cool clean the meat from the bird.  
Cut chicken into bite-size pieces, place in a bowl in 
the refrigerator for use in your soup later, or freeze for 
use in the future.   

Return the chicken bones, fat and scrapes to the cooking 
liquid or "stock" and simmer for 2 hours.  Remove from 
heat, and let stand for about 15 minutes, then strain 
through a sieve, catching the liquid, which is your pure 
chicken stock.   Either freeze your chicken stock or 
proceed with your recipe.  

I find it easy to have two stock pots going at once and 
make a double batch while everything is out and ready.  
Freeze one batch of stock and use the other immediately.  

You'll also notice no salt is in the above stock recipe, but 
in lieu of same is lemon juice.  This is because some 
people cannot tolerate salt well.  If you want, you can 
substitute the lemon juice with 2-teaspoons salt.  

Our "Recipe of the Week" is using this chicken stock in 
wonderful, delicious, nutritious homemade chicken soup.

Happy  Day!

RECIPE OF THE WEEK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Homemade Chicken Noodle Soup 
with Egg Dumplings    
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chicken stock (see instructions above)
Chicken meat - bite size pieces from 1-chicken 
previously cooked
4-stalks celery, chopped
6 carrots, chopped 
Fresh parsley (about 1/2 bunch) 
1 onion, chopped (optional)  
2 teaspoons basil 
1 teaspoon dill 
1 teaspoon tarragon 
2 teaspoons salt (optional, may substitute 
2-tablespoons lemon juice) 
1 teaspoon black pepper 
1 pkg. (12-oz.) egg noodles 

Place your chopped vegetables and seasonings in a 
clean stock pot along with about 1/4 cup of the chicken 
stock and simmer for 20 minutes stirring often.  Once 
the vegetables have cooked add all remaining chicken 
stock, bring to a simmer for another 20 minutes.  Still 
simmering, add the dry noodles.  Simmer another 
15 minutes.  

Note:  For Chicken barley soup, replace egg noodles 
with 1-cup barley. 
For Chicken rice soup, replace egg noodles with 
2 cups of uncooked rice. 

Egg Dumplings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1 Tablespoon margarine
1 cup flour
1 cup milk
4 eggs
1 can evaporated milk  
Salt and pepper (optional)

In 2-quart saucepan, melt butter or margarine, add 
flour, stirring well. Add 1-cup milk gradually until it 
forms a ball. Remove heat and add eggs, one at a 
time; mix well after each egg.  Add 1 can evaporated 
milk, salt and pepper. Mix well.  

Bring soup to a boil.  Add dumplings to soup 
1 teaspoonful at a time. Do as quickly as possible. 
Then turn heat to low - cover pot; simmer for 20 minutes.  
The secret - do not lift the lid.
