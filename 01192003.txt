Dear Recipe Fan Chris,

Over the holidays our household was central 
headquarters for bring-a-dish get togethers.  These 
"catch-as-can" feasts brought out some new-to-me 
and simply scrumptious dishes.  I'd like to share 
some of these with all of our subscribers.  

My favorite for any occasion, we'll call "Sheila's Beans".  
These can be cooked in a slow cooker; also easy or 
in your oven set at about 300-degrees.  Combine in slow 
cooker (or casserole dish, if cooking in oven): 1-1/2 cups
ketchup, 1-onion, chopped; 1-bell pepper, chopped; 
1/2 cup water, 1/2 cup packed brown sugar, 3 teaspoons 
cider vinegar, 1-teaspoon ground mustard and 2 bay 
leaves.  Then add 1-can kidney beans, 1-can great 
northern beans, 1-can lima beans, 1-can black beans 
and 1-can black-eyed peas; all of which have been 
drained before adding.  Cover and cook on low for 
5 to 7 hours.  Remove bay leaves, and serve.

Next is what we'll call "Frenchie's Lemon Muffins".  
These are so easy; mix everything with your mixer.  First 
put in 1/2 cup softened butter or margarine, then 1/2 cup 
sugar and 2 egg yolks (set aside the egg-whites to use 
later). Spin the mixer until this is mixed well.  Alternately 
add 1-cup flour, 1-teaspoon baking powder and 1/4 
teaspoon salt with 3 Tablespoons of lemon juice.  Next 
beat in a separate bowl, the egg-whites until stiff peaks 
form. Fold into batter. Fill paper-lined muffin cups 
two-thirds full.  Sprinkle with cinnamon-sugar.  Bake at 
350-degrees for 20-25 minutes  or until light golden brown.  
Makes 9 muffins. (You might want to double the recipe!)  

This one was my husband's favorite; we'll call it "Margie's 
Cheese Log".  (This would serve as a great hors d'oeuvre 
during the upcoming Super Bowl activities.)  Combine 
8-oz softened cream cheese, 1-cup shredded Cheddar 
cheese, 1/2 cup diced red onion, 1-Tablespoon 
Worcestershire sauce and 1/2-teaspoon celery seed.  
Place in refrigerator for 2 to 4 hours.  Then shape into a 
7" x 1-1/2" log.  Roll log over 1-cup finely chopped walnuts. 
Serve with crackers.  

I've saved the main course for our "Recipe of the Week".


Happy  Day!

KITCHEN TIP OF THE WEEK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Keep your refrigerator fresh smelling by putting 2-3 
Tablespoons of fresh coffee grounds in a small open 
container and set it in the back of your refrig.  It will 
remove the odors and not leave any odor behind.  
Seems to last longer than the baking soda method.
