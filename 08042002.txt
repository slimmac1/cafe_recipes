Dear Recipe Fan Chris,

Chicken 'n Dumplings anyone?  This yummy dish goes 
back through generations and many families have 
hand-me-down recipes, and there's probably b'zillion
varieties of this same dish. 

While I've always been a fair-to-midland cook, the one 
thing I could not conquer was the making of fluffy, soft 
dumplings.  Anyone else relate to making hard white 
rocks propped atop the steaming chicken?   Or how 
about so-called dumplings that are pretty as a picture, 
but are tough as leather to chew?  There's also the 
variety that does not rise and is puny globs of heavy 
dough sinking into the chicken broth or roux.  My 
experience with dumplings brought about everything 
wrong in dumpling-making until...

One day at the KOC where I volunteer, the menu was 
chicken and dumplings. I immediately offered my 
services that day to set the table, do anything but be in 
the kitchen because I well knew I'd mess up the dumplings.  
But short on help, there was no choice, I was in the kitchen.  
But alas!  We had two dumpling experts amid the group.  
And this is how I learned to make perfect dumplings every 
time.  (Rita and Pat - I and whoever else this helps, we 
thank you.)

Start with a box of Jiffy Buttermilk Biscuit Mix.  Follow 
the directions on the box to mix biscuits, but always, always 
use milk as the liquid.

It is equally important that after adding the dumplings to 
the stock to immediately cover tightly and reduce the heat
to a simmer.  Do NOT open the lid as the steam is necessary 
for the dumplings to rise.  Set your timer for 15 minutes and 
walk away.  Do not be tempted to peek at the biscuits -
that's the secret - leave that lid tightly on the pot for 
15 minutes. 

When the timer goes off, guaranteed you'll have light, fluffy 
biscuits to die for!  

Happy  Day!
