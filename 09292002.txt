Dear Recipe Fan Chris,

If you like chicken, you'll love healthy Honey-Crumb Baked
(instead of fried) Chicken.  Serve with honey-glazed carrots
and savory rice pilaf.  Add Best-Ever Cheesy Biscuits which
is our Recipe of the Week submitted by Dorothy Pearson.
Yummy!

Here we go - it's so easy, you won't believe it.  First set oven
to 375-degrees and let it preheat to temperature.

You'll need 6 boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  Wash well
and set aside for a brief time.  (Sure, you can buy the
lesser-priced chicken with bone and skin - just debone it and
rip the skin off.)

Next prepare a standard 9"x13" baking dish by lining it with
aluminum foil on bottom and up all sides. (Put the shiny side
up.)  Spread 3-Tablespoons olive oil over aluminum foil.  Pick
up pan and turn all ways so oil spreads evenly on bottom of
pan.  (Close is good enough, no need to be real fussy.)

In a shallow bowl, whisk together 1/4 cup honey and
2-Tablespoons balsamic or red wine vinegar.  In a second
shallow bowl, put 1-1/2 cups bread crumbs.  Now we're ready
to do the hard part.

(Just joking - there is no hard part.)  Roll one chicken breast at
a time - first in honey mixture, then immediately in bread crumbs,
coating all sides of chicken.  Place in oiled foil-lined pan.
Follow procedure with all 6 chicken breasts.

Bake in 375-degree oven for about 35-40 minutes.  (Halfway
through cooking, turn each piece of chicken over.) Coating will
be golden brown and look very much like the chicken you used
to fry in a frying pan.

Try it!  You'll like it!

Happy  Day!

KITCHEN TIP OF THE WEEK

Submitted by.... DirectRecipes Subscriber:  Dave

Growing up, my mother used to make the angel food cake
according to the instructions. Then split the uncooked batter
onto 4 even bowls. Then she would a different food coloring to
each quarter and layer it into the pan to make a rainbow
mixture; then cook according to instructions.
