Crock Pot Bar-B-Que Ribs  
Submitted by Lynn Z  
~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
Lay uncooked Country Style Ribs in crock pot.  
Mix one can of Coca-Cola and one cup of catsup. 
You can add instant onions or chopped onions to this,
if desired. Pour over ribs and cook 6 to 8 hours on 
medium heat. 


Crock Pot Roast  
Submitted by Angel M. DeHart  
~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
Large roast (any kind - size depends on family size, 
usually beef) 
Add: 2 cups water 
Peeled carrots, potatoes, onions (really any veggies 
your family likes)
salt and pepper 

Leave for at least 3 hours - if you need to leave it 
all day you may want to add extra water & put on 
lowest setting (you can always turn it up a little when 
you get home for an hour but it should be done anyway). 
Just pour juice over meat once on dish or you can 
make thicker gravy by just adding flour and salt, pepper 
and a little butter in a skillet - stirring with a fork as you 
cook it over low heat, when you come home. Add a little 
butter to vegetables and presto dinner is served. 

Beef Stew  
Delicious! You should try it.
Submitted by Jodi Pollock / Ohio  
~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
2 cans cream of mushroom soup
2 cans french onion soup
2 pounds stew meat

Put it all in the crock pot on low for about 2 hours.  
Then cut a few potatoes into cubes, put them in 
and I throw some baby carrots in then too.  

Then let that cook for another hour or so, testing 
the potatoes, then I add a can of peas.
Cook for another 1/2 hour stirring only a few times 
through it all.  When it is done, the meat should be
falling apart.  I then cook some noodles and ladle 
the stew over the top.

KITCHEN TIP OF THE WEEK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you've overdone the spices in a dish, a bit of sugar
will help balance it out or tone it down.

Smoked Sausage Gumbo  
Submitted by Sarah Teems / MO      
~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
1 cup chicken broth
1 can diced tomatoes - do not drain juices
1/4 cup flour
2 Tablespoons olive oil
1 pound Polish sausage, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
1 medium onion, chopped
1 green bell pepper, chopped
2 stalks of celery, chopped
1 carrot, peeled and chopped
2 teaspoons oregano 
2 teaspoons dried thyme
1/8 teaspoon ground red pepper
1 cup (uncooked) long grain rice

Combine broth and tomatoes in slow cooker 
which has been set on low.  Sprinkle flour evenly 
over bottom of a small frying pan.  Cook over high 
heat without stirring for about 3 to 4 minutes.  Stir 
in oil until smooth.  Put flour mixture into slow cooker.

Add all remaining ingredients (except rice) into 
slow cooker.  Cover and cow on low for 4-1/2 hours 
or until juices are thickened.

About 30 minutes before gumbo is done, prepare 
rice according to directions on box, (or if you have a 
rice cooker - make 2 cups rice).  Serve Gumbo over
rice.  
Note:  If your Gumbo has thickened too much just add 
additional chicken broth.
