RECIPES OF THE WEEK

Scottish Shortbread
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I have been enjoying DirectRecipes for some time and
thought that the readers might like my traditional Scottish
Shortbread recipe; it's incredibly versatile. Enjoy!
Submitted by... Ruth from Vancouver, British Columbia
~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
1 cup or 2 sticks of butter, shortening or hard margarine
1-1/2 cups of all purpose flour
1/2 cup of any other kind of flour or combination of flours
(semolina, rice, oat, etc.)

On a large work surface or in a very large bowl, combine
all of the above by kneading the ingredients together.
Alternately, use your bread machine until the mixture
looks like a ball of dough. Traditional shortbread is
flattened into an 8 by 8 pan and pricked all over with
a fork.

Then baked for 50 - 60 minutes at 300F. Here are
some variations you can try:

* add 1 or two teaspoons of vanilla or orange extract and
roll into balls with a Hershey's Kiss in the middle. Bake at
325F for 15 - 20 minutes.
* substitute 1/4 cup of the "any other kind of flour" with
cocoa and 1/3 cup sugar. Bake by either method
aforementioned.
*add dried fruit, nuts and chocolate chips, roll into a log,
and refrigerate for at least two hours. Then slice and bake
at 350 degrees for 12 to 15 minutes.

Peanut Butter Sandwich Cookies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You asked for Christmas Cookie Recipes, and I have
one that is super easy, and quick.
Submitted by... Linda Kish of Palatine, IL
~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
1 box Ritz Crackers
I jar of favorite peanut butter
2 - 12 oz bags of chocolate chips
Chopped nuts, optional

Using approx. 1 to 2 teaspoons peanut butter for each
sandwich, make peanut butter sandwiches with the
crackers, and peanut butter.

When completed, melt chocolate chips in microwave on
low ( I use a handled casserole dish so that I can stir
mixture more easily). Melt chips for 3 minutes to start,
then stir mixture, and put back in for 2-3 min. always using
your lowest setting. When chocolate is completely smooth
and melted, coat each sandwich completely, and roll in
chopped nuts if desired. Let cool on waxed paper. Can
be stored in air tight cans when completely cooled, or
refrigerated, and taken out to warm up 30 min. before
serving.

Banana Nut Bread Cookies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is my Favorite Cookie Recipe.
Submitted by... Missy May of Bellefontiane, OH
~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
1 stick butter, softened
3/4 cup sugar
2 eggs
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup wheat flour
4 large bananas, mashed
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract, not imitation
1/2 cup crushed nuts (your choice, optional)

Pre-heat oven to 350-degrees.  Sift all-purpose flour,
baking soda, and salt. Stir in wheat flour. Set aside.

Cream butter and sugar until fluffy. Add 1 egg and beat
until well blended, add last egg and beat well.  Add the
flour mixture to the creamed mixture and mix well.

Fold in the Bananas, Vanilla, and Nuts. Drop by rounded
teaspoonful onto greased cookie sheets. Place on middle
rack of the oven and bake for 15 minutes. Make sure not
to under bake them. Test just like you would Banana Nut
Bread, when the tooth pick comes out clean, the cookies
are done and delicious.

This Recipe can also be used for muffins or bread.
