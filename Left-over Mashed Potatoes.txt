Dear slimmac1,

Leftovers...what to do with them?  You can put them 
in plastic containers and store them in the refrigerator 
and one week later carefully toss them in the garbage.  
Sound familiar?

OR...you can be creative and camouflage them into another 
appetizing meal.  Here's some easy ideas.

Leftover Beef:  
(1) Mix chunks of beef into canned chili.  
(2) Make fajitas - saute slices of beef with onions, bell 
peppers and seasoning.  Serve on flour tortillas with cheese, 
tomatoes, lettuce, sour cream, and salsa on the side.  
(3) Top a prepared pizza shell with strips of beef, tomato 
sauce, sautéed bell peppers, onions, and cheese of your 
choice. Bake until hot.   
(4) Shred cooked beef, add barbeque sauce of choice.  
Serve on a roll.

Leftover Ham:  
(1) Roll Crescent Roll dough around ham slices and sliced 
Swiss cheese, then bake until golden.   
(2) Layer thinly sliced ham, lettuce leaves, cheese, and 
spicy mustard on a flour tortilla and roll up.  Add 
jalepeno peppers, if you dare.  Wrap in damp paper towel 
and warm in microwave.  
(3) Mix chopped ham with green beans and cream of mushroom 
soup; top with french-fried onions and bake until bubbly. 
(Yummy!)

Leftover Mashed Potatoes:  
(1) Add cream cheese, sour cream, and chives to mashed 
potatoes and reheat. 
(2) Mix mashed potatoes, egg and bread crumbs, salt and 
pepper together.  Form into patties and fry in pan sprayed 
with oil.  
(3) Roll balls of mashed potatoes in sliced almonds and 
bake until golden.

Leftover Ham and Potatoes:  
(1) Cold salad - Mix diced ham with cooked potatoes, 
chopped onions, boiled eggs, green peas, and ranch dressing.  
(2) Tin foil warmup - Mix diced ham, cooked potatoes, 
chopped onions, veggie of choice, and 2-Tablespoons barbeque 
sauce. Warm in  350-degree oven for 20 min.

Leftover Meatloaf:  Slice meatloaf and place in a baking dish. 
Cover with tomato sauce and top with mozzarella cheese. 
Bake until hot and bubbly. You have Meatloaf Parmesan.

Leftover Turkey:  
(1) Layer slices of turkey, ham, and Swiss cheese on white 
bread, dip into beaten egg and pan fry in butter until golden.  
(2) Sauté turkey with onions, carrots, mushrooms, and 
broccoli, then toss with cooked pasta and grated Parmesan cheese.  
(3) Heat turkey and green peas in cream of mushroom soup 
and serve over toast.

        *Quick Vegetable Beef Soup*

Leftover roast beef or pot roast
1 can of Vegetable beef soup 

Slice or dice leftover roast. Add to a can of 
Vegetable beef soup. 

This works best if you add the beef and refigerate 
a few hours before heating. The beef absorbs the 
soup flavor giving it a very "homemade" flavor.
