Dear slimmac1,

What makes a home smell like heaven on earth?
Fresh bread - still warm from the oven or bread machine!

While bread machines are the easiest and quickest method 
to make bread, any bread machine recipe can be made by hand.

How many of you complain about the price of bread today?  
Nearing two bucks a loaf now, a sandwich would cost you 
20-cents before you even buttered the bread.  Five pounds 
of bread flour costs somewhere in the range of $1.59.   This 
will cost you about 20-cents for the entire loaf of bread.  
(Give or take a little considering minor amounts of other 
ingredients added, which last over a long period of time)

I actually can put a bread together into the bread machine 
during a TV commercial while enjoying NASCAR racing.   By 
the time the checkered flag flies, the aroma of homemade 
bread is filling the kitchen.   Bread machine recipes are so 
easy; they even tell you exactly what order to add the 
ingredients.   Merely dump it all in, turn the machine on 
and just like magic - out comes sensational homemade bread.

I've heard people say that slicing the homemade bread is the 
reason they buy store bread instead.  Many of us are not 
handy with that long bread knife to cut nice even slices 
for sandwiches.  Alas, another problem solved.  There is a 
nifty bread slicer gadget.  It holds the bread on a steady 
surface and has cutting guides that you slip the knife 
between.  Cut one slice, two slices, or the entire bread all 
in nice even slices.  This is available at places like 
Walmart; it's not expensive.

See below two featured bread recipes; one made entirely in 
the bread machine and the other mixed in the bread machine 
and baked in the oven.  Can you smell that heavenly aroma?

Happy Day!
~Barb~

             RECIPES OF THE WEEK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
           *Fake Sour Dough Bread*
           ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
Here's a "quickie" recipe for one loaf of bread. I 
make this at least once a week.  Follow this 
exactly, NO SUBSTITUTIONS NO CHANGES.
The crust is to kill for. Resist the urge to cut it 
hot - it will get heavy. This recipe has no grease, 
and very little sugar. The bread will be a light
tan. And it will taste like the old fashioned Sour 
Dough bread.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
3 cups of Hi-Gluten Bread Flour - scooped, not spooned.
1 TABLESPOON yeast
1 Teaspoon sugar
1 Teaspoon salt
1 Cup plus 1 tablespoon warm water.
1 Teaspoon white vinegar

Dump all this into the machine. Yeast on the bottom - 
end with the water. Use Manual mode (1 hr. 45 min. in the 
machine. Remove. This is so exact that you may just lift 
the dough out of the machine and smack it a couple times and 
put it in a large GREASED bread pan. Let it rise until double,
bake 40 minutes in 375 degree pre-heated oven.   Enjoy!
