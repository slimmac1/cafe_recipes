Dear Recipe Fan Chris,

Thanksgiving is the fourth Thursday in November each
year.  On most tables throughout the United States, foods 
eaten at the first Thanksgiving have become traditional.  
Turkey, corn, pumpkins and cranberry sauce are symbols 
which represent the first Thanksgiving.

Sweet-sour cranberry sauce, or cranberry jelly, was on 
the first Thanksgiving table and is still served today.  The 
Indians used the fruit to treat infections. They used the 
juice to dye their rugs and blankets. Did you know that 
before the berries are put in bags to be shipped, each 
individual berry must bounce at least four inches high to 
make sure they are not too ripe?  

If you like cranberry relish, this is a quick and easy recipe 
that is sure to dazzle your Thanksgiving guests.  Place 
into your food processor, peeled and chopped: 1 navel 
orange, 1 cup drained pineapple, 12-oz. bag of cranberries, 
and 1 Granny Smith apple.  After processing, stir in 1/2 
cup sugar. Refrigerate for at least 3 hours before serving.  
Making this the night before works great. 

Along with the traditional foods for Thanksgiving, there 
are several cute ideas that can be added.  Get the kids 
to help make cornucopia snacks.  This takes only 3 
ingredients; Bugle snacks, Trix cereal and some white 
frosting.  Put a small dab of frosting in a bugle. Put 
several Trix in each "cornucopia".  

Our "Recipe of the Week" is a corn casserole that is 
sure to be a hit at any Thanksgiving table. Warning: this 
is so delicious, your family will want it throughout the
year as well.

Happy  Thanksgiving!
~Barb~
