DirectRecipes(tm) Weekly

Dear Subscriber,

Drum Roll Please ~ ~ ~ ~
Introducing  http://DirectRecipes.com

We have listened to you!  By popular request, the Staff of
DirectRecipes(tm) Newsletters brings you a one-stop recipe site.  You
asked for conversion charts, we have them.  You asked for Cooking Tips,
we have them.  We've also tossed in a special section for Basic Sauces
and another for using the many varieties of herbs.

You won't want to miss our exclusive Recipes Rol-A-Dex feature.  Here
you can click to hundreds of choices for dinner tonight.   Plan ahead,
shop and prepare for special dinners or holiday meals.  Recipes are
filed chronologically by months and occasions.

For you folks who feel like Italian tonight, or maybe an Irish Baked
Salmon is what you need for Friday night dinner, you'll enjoy our
special section of Worldly Cuisine.

Set your favorites to:  http://www.DirectRecipes.com  and invite your
friends.

Happy Day!
