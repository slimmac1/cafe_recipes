Dear Recipe Fan Chris,

Looking for new ideas for dinner?  Well, here's an old 
idea that is always enjoyed.  Dig out those recipes for 
Impossible Pies. 

The recipe list is endless of different varieties of the 
Impossible Pie.   Make a beef, ham or chicken or 
vegetable Dinner Impossible Pie, or make a luscious 
and pretty Cherry Impossible Pie for dessert.  

The convenient baked dishes make their own crust, 
almost magically with dry biscuit mix.  No rolling of dough, 
lining the pie plate, etc.  Just mix everything together and 
bake. They were popularized by Bisquick in the early 
1980's.  If you are familiar with quiche, many varieties of 
Impossible Pies resemble this dish.  

Impossible pies are best made just before serving.  
While a baked Impossible Pie will save well in the 
refrigerator for leftovers, they are not suitable for freezing, 
once baked.  

Below are a couple favorites of mine as "Recipes of the 
Week".  If you have a great Impossible Pie recipe, send 
it to Barb@DirectResponse.com along with your name 
and state of residence. We'll do a special week of all 
Impossible Pies.  

Happy Day!
~ Barb ~

KITCHEN TIP OF THE WEEK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Keep brown sugar soft and useable by placing a piece 
of bread in your container with brown sugar.  Another 
method is to place a slice of apple in hardened brown 
sugar to soften it up quickly.
