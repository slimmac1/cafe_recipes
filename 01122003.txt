Dear Recipe Fan Chris,

A wok is probably the oldest cooking utensil used in 
today's modern kitchen. The bowl-shaped pan was 
developed by the ancient Chinese.  A good wok is 
made of very heavy-gauge rolled carbon steel, which 
conducts heat well. Ideal for wok cookery is a gas 
stove. However, you will find electric woks in today's 
market. 

Today's most popular use of a wok is stir frying. One 
thing to remember is not to heat the oil in the wok before
adding ingredients. This will cause your food to stick to 
the wok. The term used by professional Chinese cooks 
is "hot wok -- cold oil".  

When meat and vegetables are to be combined, cook 
the meat first, until near done. Take it out of the wok, set 
it aside and keep it warm. Clean the wok with a paper 
towel, reheat to a very high temperature and again add 
oil, then immediately the first vegetables to be cooked. 

The first vegetables usually are carrots, potatoes or any 
that require longer cooking time. Food in your wok should 
be continuously stirred and turned. Add other vegetables. 
When near done, return meat to the wok. Next add 
seasonings or sauce, which are always added last to 
avoid food from becoming soggy.  

Wok cooking is fast and easy. The most difficult part is 
cutting up the ingredients. Have all ingredients ready 
to add nearby the wok. Enjoy using your wok and eat 
healthy.

Happy  Day!

KITCHEN TIP OF THE WEEK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can flavor your olive oil before using in cooking. 
Begin with 1 cup of olive oil, add a couple cloves of 
garlic, or maybe 1/4 teaspoon rosemary, or 1/4 
teaspoon thyme; whatever herb flavoring you 
particularly like.  Store flavored oil in the refrigerator 
for up to two weeks for use in your daily cooking.
