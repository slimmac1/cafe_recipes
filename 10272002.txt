Dear Recipe Fan Chris,

In the good old days, when a "soup bunch" cost a nickel 
and bones were a gratuity from the butcher and green 
veggies grew in the garden, homemade soups were 
frequently on the menu.  

While it costs plenty more today to brew up a pot of 
good soup, the same warm, wonderful flavor still exists.  
A good stock is the foundation of a good soup.  Any 
meat that is first immersed in cold water and simmered 
for a long period is bound to give its best flavor to the 
cooking liquid.  

Next time you have a ham bone, don't toss it away.  Think 
hot, steamy split pea soup.  Save a bit of the ham with it 
as well.  Go to your local grocer and get a bag of green 
split peas.  (Yeah, the stores still do sell these morsels.)  

Put your ham bone and pieces of ham in a big pot of cold 
water.  Then bring to a boil, turn burner down and simmer 
for about 4 hours.  

Remove ham bone and leave about 8 cups of stock in pot.  
Add 1-lb of split peas (about 2-1/4 cups), your ham pieces 
and an onion diced up.  Bring to a boil for about 2 minutes, 
then remove pot from burner (leave cover on pot) let sit for 
about an hour.  

Meanwhile dice up 2 big carrots and 2 stalks of celery.  
Add carrots and celery and simmer for about 45 minutes 
to an hour.  Split pea soup should be thick.  

Now if you enjoy soups and don't have the time to bother 
with making them yourself, jump on the three full-size 'free' 
samples offered below.  These soups combine flavorful 
stock with dried veggies. You just add water and heat.  
I personally use these soups often and can tell you they 
are as good as homemade!  

Happy  Day!

RECIPE OF THE WEEK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Here's one of my favorite easy recipes. 
....Submitted by Bonnie Gillette-Lunsford

Hamburg Soup  
~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~  
1/2 bunch of Celery
1 large white onion, peeled
2 pounds ground round  
4-5 teaspoons of Better Than Bouillon Chicken Base 
(Superior Touch makes this)
(You can substitute with chicken bouillon granules, but 
just doesn't taste as good.) 
10 to 12 cups of water 
2-1/2 cups of small elbow macaroni 
Italian Seasoning - season to taste

Fill your pan with water, onion, and celery. Boil the water, 
add your 'Better Than Bouillon', check and taste to make 
sure it is a nice tasting broth. Cook your ground round in 
a frying pan, drain all of the fat. Now add your ground 
round to the soup base--(the water pot that has your 
bouillon in it). If it appears that there is too much soup 
base, pour some out. Add your tomato sauce. Make sure 
it is the right consistency for soup. Add your macaroni, 
stir well. Add salt and pepper to taste. Your soup is done 
when the celery and macaroni are tender. Serve with fresh 
baked sourdough rolls. Enjoy!  Total cooking time: 
approximately 40 minutes
