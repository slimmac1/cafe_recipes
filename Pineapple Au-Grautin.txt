Dear slimmac1,

Think fresh pineapple!

Don't let the awkward and prickly encased fruit scare you.  With a few simple directions, you can peel, cut and serve mouth-watering fresh pineapple tonight.

Begin by trimming the leaves and the base. Set the pineapple on its side. Using a large chef's knife, cut along the shoulder of the fruit, about an inch below the long pointy leaves, to remove all traces of the fibrous top. Then slice off about 1/2 inch of the base so the fruit will stand upright.

Remove the rind. Stand the pineapple on a cutting board and cut off vertical strips of rind, following the contours of the fruit and cutting deep enough to remove the dark, prickly spots known as eyes. After removing all the rind, go back and trim away any remaining eyes.

For rings, cut the peeled, uncored pineapple into thin or thick rounds. Punch out the core from each slice.   For wedges. chunks, or bite-size pieces, cut the fruit lengthwise into quarters. Cut away the woody core by slicing along the length of each piece just under the core. Then slice into wedges or chunks

You'll want to keep a few cans of pineapple slices, chunks or wedges on hand for impromptu salads, desserts or to include with chicken, pork chops or rice dishes.

Surprisingly, most name brand canned pineapple is grown in Thailand and the Philippines.  If you want genuine Hawaiian canned pineapple, check your store brand pineapple.  Look at the top of the can for the wording "100% Hawaiian U.S.A."

Fresh or canned, try adding the sweet delectable pineapple to your menu this week.

Happy Day!

KITCHEN TIP OF THE WEEK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Pineapple does not ripen further once it is picked.
If pineapple is not being served immediately, then
the fruit should be cut from the shell (preserving as
much juice as possible), and refrigerated in an
airtight container. Use within one week.
