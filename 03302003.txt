Dear Recipe Fan Chris,

Easter foods are multi-colored, appetizing and bring a 
breath of Spring into the air.  This week we're happy to 
add dessert recipes from our subscribers as well as a 
very special Easter Torte.  This Easter torte is delightfully 
rich, easy to make and will appeal to the taste buds of 
every family member and guest.  

Easter Torte:  No crust necessary; just cream together 
1-1/2 lbs. Ricotta Cheese, 1-lb. cream cheese and 1-1/2 
cups sugar.  In a mixer, blend in 6 eggs, adding one at 
time, and mixing well between each addition.   Then add 
2-Tablespoons vanilla, again mixing well.  Add 6 
Tablespoons flour, again one at time, mixing well.  Then 
add 1-pint sour cream, once again mixing well.  

The mixture will be loose; not to worry.  Pour mixture into 
a 10" spring form cake pan.  Bake at 325-degrees for one 
hour.  Let cake cool to room temperature, then refrigerate.  
Remove from spring form cake pan onto a pretty dish for 
serving.  

This Easter Cheese Torte blends well with all other Easter 
colors and foods.  You can add a soft pastel food coloring 
to mix, if desired.  Two drops of red food coloring makes a
pretty pastel pink.    

On to more Easter desserts submitted by our subscribers.  
If you have a tried-and-true Easter dinner recipe to share

Happy Day!

KITCHEN TIP OF THE WEEK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Are the eggs you are boiling for decorated Easter Eggs 
fresh? To determine whether an egg is fresh, immerse 
it in a pan of cool, salted water. If it sinks, it's fresh. If it 
floats, throw it away.

Easter Egg Cake  

Thanks for your weekly ideas. I only have one 
Easter-fun item.
Submitted by... Sherrie Griffith of Danville, IL  

Bake a cake using a regular store-bought cake mix, but 
bake it in a glass oven-safe bowl. 

Once baked and cooled, cut down the middle, from top 
to bottom. If there is a large rounded top, it may be 
necessary to cut some of the top off to become flatter. 
On a large flat plate or platter, butt the top edges together, 
laying the cake on the cut-down-the-middle edges. It will 
resemble the shape of an Easter Egg. 

Frost the cake with white icing. Decorate with jelly beans. 
Put some shredded coconut in a baggie and add a few 
drops of green food coloring. Mix the food coloring to evenly 
color the coconut, then spread it around the egg. It will look 
like a giant Easter egg sitting on grass. It makes a nice 
center piece for a family dinner.
