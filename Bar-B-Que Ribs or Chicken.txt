Dear Subscriber,

Outdoor grilling and barbequeing is a highlight for Pop's Day!  

Break out the grill as steaks, burgers, vegies and barbeque 
chicken become the highlighted recipes.  Here's some tips 
for your upcoming sizzlers on the grill.  

This year you may want to try a different taste.  Mix up this 
dry marinade; store in a small glass jar for use when needed.  
6 Tb. lemon pepper, 2 Tb. paprika, 2 Tb. thyme, 2 tsp. garlic 
powder, 1 tsp. sugar, 1/2 tsp. salt, 1/4 tsp. gr. coriander, 
1/8 tsp. gr. cumin and 1/8 tsp. cayenne pepper.  

Two hours before your steaks hit the grill, rub marinade 
generously into the meat.  Get prepared for comments like 
"the best steak I've ever eaten!"   

If your delight is ribs, first coat them generously with any 
mustard, then shake the above dry marinade generously over 
mustard.  You will not taste the mustard, but it will hold the 
flavorings onto your ribs and make a tasty light coating.  
Try it - you'll like it!  

Don't skip the vegies.  They are excellent on the grill.  A quick 
and easy method is to slice up your potatoes, zucchini, yellow 
squash and maybe some red onion; coat lightly with olive; 
garlic salt and pepper to taste.  Wrap in heavy duty aluminum 
foil.  Start your vegie package about 15 minutes before your 
steak or burgers.  

Another method of doing vegies on the grill is to bring out your 
wok.  Remove the grating, set the wok into the coals, with the 
briquets surrounding the outside of the wok.  Stir fry until tender 
crisp.

If you're planning to smother your entree with onions, here's a 
method that will fill the air with appetizing delight as well.  
Slice your onions, then coat lightly with olive oil and wrap in 
heavy duty aluminum foil.  Place by/near/on the fire to make 
the onions begin to cook slowly.

Happy Father's Day!

KITCHEN TIP OF THE WEEK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
How to tell when the Ribs are done.....  
Pinch the meat from the bone.  It should come off 
easily.  If not, cook awhile longer and test again.

RECIPE OF THE WEEK 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Bar-B-Que Ribs or Chicken *
This sauce will keep in fridge up to 3 weeks. Sauce flavor 
improves with age. Submitted by..Bruce Glover Tehuacana,TX 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
3 pounds short ribs (or chicken cut in half) 

The Day Before Grilling the Ribs: 
Prepare Sauce:
Add all ingredients, all other spices and bring to a boil. 
Simmer on low heat 30 min. to 1 hour; stirring as needed. 
Sauce: 
1 or 2 cans of beer 
1-1/2 tablespoons brown sugar 
1/4 to 1/2 cup cider vinegar 
1 small can tomato paste 
2 cans tomato sauce 
1 teaspoon dry mustard 
1-1/2 teaspoons garlic powder 
1/2 teaspoon sage 
1/2 teaspoon oregano powder 
1 Tablespoon Italian seasoning 
1/4 teaspoon powdered caraway seed 
1-1/2 teaspoons dillweed 
1 teaspoon rosemary 
1 teaspoon Cilantro leaves 
1/4 teaspoon marjoram 
3/4 teaspoon basil leaves 
1/4 teaspoon powdered ginger 
3 Tablespoons worcestershire sauce 
1 Tablespoon ground cinnamon 
2 teaspoons chili powder 
2 Tablespoons hot sauce 
3 bottles liquid smoke 
add salt to taste 

Day of Grilling:
Place the ribs on the grill so they are not directly over the 
coals or flame and cover the grill so that smoke collects 
inside. If your grill does not have a cover, improvise one 
made of aluminum foil. Cook for 1 hour or until done, 
basting with barbecue sauce every 10 minutes. When ribs 
are done, cover with foil and cook for 1 hour more on grill 
remove to a platter and serve. 

Covered in foil, this recipe can be cooked in 350 degree oven 
for 2 hours or until done. Baste ribs in sauce before cooking. 

This sauce will keep in fridge up to 3 weeks. Sauce flavor 
improves with age. Serves 6. Serve extra sauce on the side.
