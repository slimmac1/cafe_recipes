Dear Recipe Fan Chris,

It's October - and apples are ripe, juicy and plentiful.  
Apples lend to a multitude of uses in cooking.   While 
there is a long, long list of apples known for baking 
purposes, the most popular and most-likely to find in 
your grocery store are McIntosh, Granny Smith, Golden 
Delicious, Rome Beauty and Winesap.  Following is a 
couple of my favorite ways to use cooking apples. 

Apple Krisp  
Peel, core and slice 12 apples.  I use Rome Beauty 
apples, but other baking apples work just as well. Spread 
evenly in a medium-sized baking dish.  Sprinkle cinnamon 
over top of apples.  How much cinnamon you use is 
according to your own taste.  I use about 3-Tablespoons, 
but my hubby loves cinnamon - so this may be a bit much 
for someone else.  Then pour 1/2 cup of water over top.

In a separate bowl, mix together: 3/4 cup oatmeal and 
3/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 teaspoon baking powder 
and 1/4 cup melted butter or margarine.  Spread this 
mixture over the top of apples, cinnamon and water.  
Bake 45 minutes in 350-degree oven.  Serve Warm, if 
desired.  This is also good with whipping cream or ice 
cream on top.  

Super Easy Apple Pie  
* Place 1 prepared crust in bottom of pie plate; flute 
edges. 
* Preheat oven to 450-degrees.
* In a large bowl, mix together: 8 Granny Smith apples, 
peeled, cored and sliced and 1-2/3 cups sour cream 
and 1-cup sugar and 1/3-cup flour and 1 egg and 
2-teaspoons vanilla and 1/2-teaspoon salt.  Pour 
mixture into pie crust.  (No top crust) 
* Bake 10 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 
350-degrees. Continue baking about 40 minutes longer. 
Filling will be puffy and a golden brown.  
* While that part is baking, mix together:  1-cup 
chopped walnuts and 1/2 cup flour and 1/3-cup brown 
sugar and 1/3-cup granulated sugar, and 1-Tablespoon 
cinnamon and 1/2 cup softened butter or margarine.  
(Mixture will be crumbly)
* Spoon walnut mixture over top of hot pie and bake 
15 minutes longer.

Autumn is for apples - don't let the Fall season pass you 
by without cooking with apples.  I'll be trying the Recipe of 
Week, which is submitted by our subscriber, Ann Lott.  
How unique to wrap the apples in the crust like a big ol' 
apple dumpling!  Thanks Ann, sounds like a great 
apple recipe!

Happy  Day!

KITCHEN TIP OF THE WEEK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To bake potatoes more quickly, soak for about 
20 minutes in salt water before baking.  This works 
well when microwaving as well.
